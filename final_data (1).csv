"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Al Jazeera Staff,India election 2024: Why isn’t Modi’s BJP fielding candidates in Kashmir?,Absence of the prime minister's party from electoral fray in Muslim-majority region seen as a sign of its unpopularity.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/13/india-election-2024-why-isnt-modis-bjp-fielding-candidates-in-kashmir,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP19144362432698-1715085583.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,2024-05-13T04:56:59Z,"The absence of the prime minister’s party from the electoral fray in the Muslim-majority region is seen as a sign of its unpopularity.
Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir – More than a month into India’s giant seven-phase national election, the Kashmir Valley will finally begin to cast its votes in one constituency, on May 13. The Indian-administered region will vote for two other constituencies on May 20 and May 25.
But missing from the fray is India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), known for its aggressive electoral ambitions, win-at-all-costs approach and aspirations of breaking ground in parts of the country where it has traditionally not had much success.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party has not fielded candidates in any of the three seats in the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.
Experts and rivals argue the Hindu majoritarian party wants to avoid an outcome that may challenge its claims of bringing development and peace to the Himalayan region, which has seen decades of armed rebellion against Indian rule.
The BJP denies that it has anything to hide and insists the region has changed for the better since Modi’s government in 2019 scrapped Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which had granted a measure of autonomy to Indian-administered Kashmir. New Delhi also split the region into two federally-governed territories: Jammu and Kashmir as well as Ladakh.
Some analysts view the 2024 elections in Kashmir as a referendum on those 2019 moves, which the BJP claimed had widespread support in the disputed region. So why did the party not field candidates in the Kashmir valley?
Al Jazeera spoke to more than a dozen residents and experts in the Kashmir Valley to try to answer this question. One key thread emerged: Everyday Kashmiris are still angry with with BJP’s decision to scrap the region’s special status and order a subsequent security crackdown that saw thousands of people arrested.
The local administration run from New Delhi has also clamped down on free speech, arresting journalists and shutting down news sites critical of the federal government. High unemployment, power shortages and a lack of basic infrastructure plague the region, and many Kashmiris say these issues remain unaddressed.
 

 
While some of the people Al Jazeera spoke with said this anger would be reflected in Kashmir’s election results, others revealed they would not bother to vote at all. “I will abstain from voting as none of the issues facing people have been addressed,” 33-year-old Saqib, a resident of Baramulla in northern Kashmir, told Al Jazeera.
“I have a PhD in social sciences but earn a meagre $200 monthly from a private teaching job. What do I vote for when there is little hope?” Saqib, who did not want his full name disclosed for fear of retribution, said.
“If anyone is excited about this election exercise, it is the loyal voter base of different political parties and their workers,” he said, referring to the pro-Indian Kashmir-based parties such as the National Conference (NC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The NC and the PDP have also been targets of crackdowns by the Modi government.
Syed Aga Ruhulla, the NC candidate from Srinagar, told Al Jazeera that the election was an opportunity for Kashmiri voters “to express their dissent”.
“They have to show they don’t accept it,” he said, referring to the anger against the unilateral decision to revoke Article 370.
He said people feel disfranchised because the state legislature has been suspended since 2019, so Kashmiris have no local government and, therefore, little say in the governance of this ecologically sensitive region.
Kashmiris fear their land and culture are under attack. Article 370 had barred outsiders from buying land and settling in Kashmir but with that safeguard gone, many fear the BJP might try to engineer a demographic shift in the region.
The “BJP knows that if it contests in Kashmir, the election will become a referendum of sorts on Article 370, and it will land the party in an embarrassing position”, Muhammad, a political analyst based in Kashmir who did not want his full name used, told Al Jazeera.
Last month, Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah said during an election rally in Jammu that the BJP wants to win the hearts of the people and is in no rush “to see the lotus [its party symbol] bloom in the [Kashmir] Valley”.
The BJP has not won any of the three Kashmir seats – Srinagar, Baramulla and Anantnag-Rajouri – since it started running in 1996. Srinagar votes on May 13, Baramulla on May 20, and Anantnag-Rajouri on May 25.
Until recently, it looked like the BJP would look to compete in Kashmir. Just two months ago, days before the national election was announced, Modi visited Srinagar, the region’s biggest city, for the first time since the 2019 scrapping of Article 370.
“I am working hard to win your hearts, and my attempt to keep winning your hearts will continue,” Modi said.
The BJP government passed a law in parliament that offers affirmative action in jobs to a mountain-dwelling tribe, in a move that sparked tensions in the region and led to accusations that Modi and his team were trying to polarise Kashmiri society to win the loyalty of select communities.
The party, should, in theory, also have been a beneficiary of gerrymandering in some constituencies: Parts of two districts from the Hindu-majority Jammu region were added to the Anantnag constituency.
So, what changed?
Analysts such as Muhammad argue that the BJP realised it does not stand a chance in the election, especially if local parties such as the NC and PDP were able to rally their support base.
However, Ashok Kaul, a senior BJP leader in the region, defended the move to not contest the election in Kashmir.
[The] “BJP already contested in two seats [from the Jammu region]”, Kaul said.
He also said that federal rule over Kashmir, under Modi, had transformed the region for the better.
“There are no shutdowns now, children attend school regularly and no one issues protest calendars. The young men no longer throw stones. Our work speaks for itself.”
Kaul was referring to the eruption of street protests in the 2010s when Kashmiri youth pelted security forces with stones in response to civilian killings. Hundreds of Kashmiris were blinded when the security forces responded with pellet guns to suppress the protests.
The BJP has emerged as a dominant player in the Jammu region in the past decade as Jammu and Kashmir’s politics have been polarised along religious and regional lines.
Voting has already taken place for the two seats in the Hindu-majority Jammu region [Jammu and Udhampur], both of which the BJP won in 2014 and 2019.
The NC, which has been the ruling party for most of the time since the region’s accession into India, and the PDP are the main players in the Kashmir Valley, while the Indian National Congress and the BJP enjoy influence in Jammu.
The NC and the PDP are part of the Congress-led opposition INDIA bloc, which is challenging the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) federally. However, both these regional constituents of the INDIA coalition are competing against each other in Kashmir.
The Apni Party and the People’s Conference, two other parties running in Kashmir, have faced accusations from critics that they are proxies for the BJP – an allegation they deny.
One of the main claims made by the BJP regarding the abrogation of Article 370 was that it would eradicate “terrorism” and improve the region’s security situation. However, attacks have continued in the region.
While the Kashmir Valley, historically a hotbed of rebellion, has experienced a decline in attacks, the rebels have gradually shifted their base to peripheral districts, such as Rajouri and Poonch in the Jammu region. These districts have witnessed a surge in rebel attacks since 2021.
Overall, however, the region has seen a significant reduction in casualties among civilians and security forces.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the number of security force casualties has declined over the past five years from 80 in 2019 to 33 in 2023. Likewise, civilian deaths have declined from 44 in 2019 to 12 in 2023.
But residents in Indian-administered Kashmir say their development-related woes continue. For the past several weeks, Kashmir has seen extended hours of electrical outages, making it the worst power crisis in years.
Kashmir’s unemployment rate stands at 18.5 percent, according to official figures, against the national average of 7.6 percent. Kashmiris are mostly reliant on government jobs, which have shrunk since the 2019 changes and are now also open to outsiders.
A proposed railway line has triggered protests from apple farmers in the Shopian district, who fear that it would result in the destruction of apple orchards and rob the local people of their livelihoods in a region where horticulture is the mainstay of the economy.
“We need development that also thinks about the welfare of locals and is done in consultation with the Indigenous people,” said Shabiya Rashid, a scholar at a local university.
Kashmir has been without a democratically elected government since 2019, and bureaucrats sent by New Delhi run the region of 12 million people.
“Who do we approach for the local issues? There is no one,” Ubaid Ahmad, a resident of Srinagar, told Al Jazeera.
Last year, the Supreme Court ordered the government to conduct elections for the state assembly by September this year.
“Any assembly election cannot be delayed for more than six months, but there have been no elections for the last six years. This is a violation of the constitution and law, indicating that the democracy the state boasts of does not extend to Kashmir,” NC leader Ruhulla said.
MW Malla, a New Delhi-based Kashmiri researcher, pointed out that the central government conducted elections even at the peak of the rebellion in Kashmir in the 1990s, when separatists called for a boycott.
Still, even without an elected regional administration, many Kashmiris like Mushkoor Ahmad, a Srinagar resident, view the national election with hope.
“It is an important election for our collective identity,” he said. “I just hope that when the results are out on June 4, it signals an end to our misery.”

"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Al Jazeera Staff,India Lok Sabha election 2024 Phase 4: Who votes and what’s at stake?,People from across 10 states and union territories will vote on May 13 to elect 96 MPs for the Lok Sabha.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/12/india-lok-sabha-election-2024-phase-4-who-votes-and-whats-at-stake,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP19144362432698-1715085583.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,2024-05-12T05:12:01Z,"A total of 96 constituencies across 10 states and union territories will vote on May 13 in the fourth phase of the Lok Sabha elections.
India is bracing itself for the fourth phase of its weeks-long elections on May 13 to elect 96 members of parliament to the Lok Sabha, or the lower house of parliament, as the world’s largest electoral exercise moves into its final month.
The two main contenders for power are Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of 26 parties led by the main opposition party, Rahul Gandhi‘s Indian National Congress.
Last week, the third phase of the voting saw Modi cast his vote in Gujarat’s Gandhinagar constituency. It also saw the competition between the two main contenders heighten as the Congress Party’s former President Sonia Gandhi said Modi and the BJP were focusing “only on gaining power at any cost”.
The fourth phase also features a bit of glamour in the east of the country, where Bollywood veteran Shatrughan Sinha is seeking re-election in West Bengal’s Asansol, and to the south, where actress Maadhavi Latha from the BJP is standing for the Hyderabad seat in Telangana. Latha is pitted against Asaduddin Owaisi, a four-time MP from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party.

The first three phases of the election, which were held on April 19, April 26 and May 7, saw a voter turnout of 66.1, 66.7, and 61 percent, respectively. The voting so far has been lower than in the 2019 elections. In total, 969 million people are registered to vote in 543 parliamentary constituencies across 36 states and federally-governed union territories.
Registered voters across nine states and a union territory will cast their ballots for the following constituencies:
Hyderabad (Telangana): Asaduddin Owaisi is being challenged by the BJP’s Maadhavi Latha in his family bastion. Owaisi’s brother, Akbaruddin Owaisi is a member of the state legislative assembly while his father, Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi, represented the parliamentary constituency, with a substantial Muslim population, six times. Owaisi pitches himself as the voice of India’s Muslim minority whose issues he regularly raises in his parliamentary debates. Owaisi was given the “best parliamentarian” award in 2022.
Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir): This constituency in Kashmir registered just 15 percent voting in the 2019 election, which was marred by a boycott. This is the first parliamentary election in Kashmir since the region’s special status was removed in August 2019. The two biggest mainstream pro-India parties in the region – the National Conference and People’s Democratic Party – have fielded Aga Syed and Waheed Parra, respectively, as their candidates.
 

 
Krishnanagar, Baharampur and Asansol (West Bengal): These three parliamentary contests in West Bengal state, bordering Bangladesh, offer a mix of star power and political significance. Bollywood actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha is seeking re-election from Asansol, while ex-cricketer Yusuf Pathan is taking on senior Congress Party leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who has been representing Bahrampur since 1999. Chowdhury was also the leader of the opposition Congress Party in the outgoing Lok Sabha. Pathan is the candidate of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the party that rules the state and is also aligned with the national opposition INDIA alliance – even though the coalition’s members are standing against each other in West Bengal.
Yet, the most high-profile electoral battle in the state on May 13, is in Krishnanagar, where the fiery TMC parliamentarian and fierce critic of Modi, Mahua Moitra, is seeking a second term. A former vice president of JPMorgan Chase based in London, Moitra entered politics in 2009. Her parliamentary speeches asking tough questions of the government often go viral. In December 2023, the firebrand MP was expelled from parliament after being accused of accepting cash to ask questions. She said her expulsion was a way to silence her. She has challenged her expulsion in the Supreme Court. The BJP has fielded Amrita Roy, whose husband is a descendant of the erstwhile king of the region, against Moitra.
Kannauj and Lakhimpur Kheri (Uttar Pradesh): Akhilesh Yadav, the leader of the Samajwadi Party – a regional powerhouse that has seen its influence shrink with the BJP’s rise – has decided to enter the electoral race in Kannauj in northern Uttar Pradesh state, which accounts for 80 seats in the parliament. The BJP currently governs the state. Kannauj, known for its perfume industry, has been a Yadav family bastion. Akhilesh, his father Mulayan Singh Yadav and his wife Dimple Yadav have represented the seat since 1999. But in 2019, Dimple lost to the BJP in a shock defeat. Akhilesh’s entry into the electoral fray is an attempt to wrest back the family pocket borough.
The other seat that has attracted a lot of attention is Lakhimpur Kheri, where controversial federal Minister of Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni is seeking re-election. Mishra has been caught in a storm since his son Ashish Mishra allegedly ran his car over farmers protesting against now-repealed farm laws. Ashish is out on bail and farmers’ groups as well as activists have been demanding that Mishra be denied a ticket by the BJP.
Indore (Madhya Pradesh): This constituency, a stronghold of the BJP, has been in the news for unlikely reasons. The Congress candidate Akshay Kanti Bam withdrew from the race at the last minute, after the last date for candidates to file nominations had passed. The Congress could not field a replacement and Bam later joined the BJP. Thirteen other candidates are in the fray, but the Congress Party has urged voters to opt for NOTA (none of the above) in protest.
 

 
Voting will begin at 7am local time (01:30 GMT) and end at 6pm (12:30 GMT). Voters already in the queue by the time polls close will get to vote, even if that means keeping polling stations open longer.
Complete election results for all phases are to be released on June 4.

 
The first three phases of the Lok Sabha elections have already decided the fate of 284 MPs.
So far, voting has concluded for all seats in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Meghalaya, Assam, Manipur, Karnataka, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura; the Andaman and Nicobar islands; and the Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman, Diu, Lakshadweep and Puducherry union territories.
The fifth phase will kick off on May 20 and the sixth on May 25, before the election heads towards the seventh and final phase on June 1.

Indian President Droupadi Murmu and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar were among the early voters in the nation’s capital. “We want people to vote in huge numbers as the country is making a very big decision,” Jaishankar told the media after casting his ballot.
The parliamentary election, which will determine the next government, has been plagued by low voter turnout amid a heatwave and record temperatures in several parts of the country. Overall, around 970 million Indians are eligible to vote.
Rahul and Sonia Gandhi, the leaders of the Indian National Congress, the biggest opposition party in India, also cast their votes in the capital on Saturday. “Mother and I contributed to this great festival of democracy by casting our votes,” Rahul wrote in a caption to a selfie of the two on X (formerly Twitter).
In the post, he also reiterated the Congress’ pre-election promises, including jobs for 300,000 young people and a monthly payment of 8,500 India rupees ($102) for poor women, and ridding farmers of debt. Gandhi is running from two constituencies: Wayanad in Kerala and his family’s fortress of Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was released on bail earlier this month to campaign in the election, was another prominent leader who voted in the capital. “I voted against dictatorship, unemployment and inflation,” Kejriwal said after casting his vote.
Kejriwal is the co-founder and leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, which is in power in the Delhi region (the Indian capital has its own legislative assembly and elected government). The politician was arrested in April in an alleged corruption case linked to liquor tax policy. On May 10, the Supreme Court granted Kejriwal temporary bail. He will have to surrender and return to jail on June 2, the day after the six-week election wraps up.

Apart from the nation’s capital, polling is also being held in the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Haryana.
Meanwhile, turmoil has once again been reported in West Bengal, which is ruled by the All Indian Trinamool Congress party. The ruling party’s workers allegedly blocked the car of Agnimitra Paul, a BJP candidate, as she proceeded to vote in the Medinipur constituency, causing clashes, according to Indian media.
The seventh and final round of voting will be held on June 1, and the results declared on June 4.

"{'id': 'rt', 'name': 'RT'}",RT,Trans Democracy: Five transgender candidates in India’s 2024 election seek to win back the respect they had millenia ago,"Non-binaries existed in Indian mythology and ancient texts, but colonial law made them outcasts Read Full Article at RT.com",https://www.rt.com/india/597965-five-transgender-contestants-india/,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/664cbc1285f540566253bd75.jpg,2024-05-22T03:33:39Z,"In the ongoing seven-phase parliamentary election to determine whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will get a third term, India’s 970 million voters include over 48,000 transgender people.
And of the 8,039 candidates nationwide – a four-fold rise from 1,874 in the 1952 election, India’s first – three candidates are transgender; a fourth dropped out. And a fifth is hoping to sit in the state assembly of Andhra Pradesh in south India, for which voting was on May 13.
India has long had a tolerance for transgender persons, however this has nothing to do with the Western LGBTQ+ movement – indeed, Indians are merely trying to overcome the colonial-era laws that tried to stamp out its own ancient traditions on the 'third gender'.
The transgender community comprises Hijras, eunuchs, Kothis, Aravanis, Jogappas, Shiv-Shakthis, and more. Evidence for the existence of third-gender people can be found in Hindu holy texts like the Ramayana and Mahabharata.
In Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, and further back in Vedic culture, three genders were recognized. The Vedas (1500 BCE to 500 BCE) describe individuals as one of three categories according to one’s nature (‘prakrti’). These are also spelled out in the Kama Sutra (c. 4th century AD) and elsewhere as pums-prakrtistri-prakrti (female nature), and tritiya-prakrti (third-nature).
Various texts suggest that ‘third sex’ individuals were known in pre-modern India and included male-bodied or female-bodied people as well as intersexual. Third sex is also discussed in ancient Hindu law, medicine, linguistics, and astrology.
Indian linguist Patanjali’s work on Sanskrit grammar, the Mahabhaya (200 BCE), states that Sanskrit’s three grammatical genders are derived from three natural genders.
The earliest Tamil grammar, the Tolkappiyam (3rd century BCE) also refers to hermaphrodites as a third ‘neuter’ gender (in addition to a feminine category of unmasculine males). In the Puranas, there are also references to three kinds of devas of music and dance: apsaras (female), Gandharvas (male), and kinnars (neuter).
In the Vishnu Purana (orally composed during the 1st millennium BCE), the God Vishnu changes form to become Mohini (enchantress) to fool a group of demons into giving up their elixir.
In the Ramayana (300 BCE), when Lord Rama goes into exile in the forest, the hijras of Ayodhya follow him. In the Mahabharata (400 BCE), there are several instances: in one, the God Krishna, becomes a woman to spend a warrior’s last night with him. The fierce warrior-king Arjuna spends a year in hiding as a female dancing instructor. A warrior Shikhandini changes her sex to become a man, and in battle kills the patriarch Bhishma (who doesn’t put up a fight because she was ‘born a woman’).
Hijras played a famous role in the royal courts of the Islamic world, particularly in the Ottoman empire and the Mughal rule in Medieval India. They rose to become political advisors, administrators, generals as well as guardians of the harems. Hijras were considered clever, trustworthy, and fiercely loyal and had access to all the population, thereby playing a crucial role in the politics of the Mughal era.
At the beginning of the British Raj, hijras accepted protections and benefits from some Indian states through entry into the hijra community.
From the 18th century onwards, the situation changed drastically. In the second half of the 19th century, the British colonial administration vigorously sought to criminalize the hijra community and deny them civil rights. Hijras were considered to be separate castes or tribes in different parts of India by the colonial administration.
The Criminal Tribes Act, of 1871, included all hijra who were concerned with kidnapping and castrating children and dressed like women to dance in public places. The punishment was up to two years imprisonment and a fine or both. This era has made the hijra as vulnerable as they appear in the contemporary world. Though the Act was repealed in 1952, its legacy continues. Many local laws reflect prejudicial attitudes against certain tribes, including against hijras.

“Most transgender people are not able to fight for their rights as they are not educated,” says Rajan Singh, a non-binary contestant in the South Delhi Lok Sabha (lower house) constituency that votes on May 25. Singh is currently undergoing the process of gender reassignment surgery.
“I don’t have a personal aim,” Singh continues. “I want to fight for my community to live by upholding our identity. That fight is the core of my life.”
Besides Rajan Singh, for whom a court recently ordered police protection, the candidates include:
Durga Bai Majhwar, an independent ‘kinnar’ (transgender) candidate in the Damoh constituency of Madhya Pradesh (in central India), which voted on April 26. Durga’s opponents are Rahul Lodhi of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the main opposition Congress party’s Sarwar Singh Lodhi.
Then there is Sunaina Singh in Dhanbad, a coal-mining center in Jharkhand, east India. Sunaina is fighting the BJP’s Dulu Mahato and the Congress’s Anupama Singh, and voting is on May 25.
Mahamandaleshwar (the title for a monk) Hemangi Sakhi, was contemplating a challenge to Modi in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh (UP), India’s most populous state. Varanasi votes on June 1.
The transgender monk is from the far-right Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, an outfit that is older than the nationalist paramilitary Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP’s parent organization. However, Sakhi has been persuaded not to contest after BJP leaders gave an assurance that they would make Modi aware of the concerns of transgender persons. 
The only non-parliamentary candidate is Tamanna Simhadri, who is contesting the Pithapuram assembly seat in Andhra Pradesh on behalf of the pro-dalit Bharatiya Chaitanya Yuvajana Party. (Dalits sit at the bottom of India’s unique caste pyramid.)
Tamanna’s main opponents are movie-star-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan, whose Janasena Party is allied with the BJP in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and Vanga Geetha of the YSR Congress Party (which is the incumbent state ruling party). Voting took place on May 13.
Tamanna is a trans woman, having undergone gender reassignment surgery.

A ‘transgender’ is a person who no longer identifies with their gender assigned at birth. Those who choose change through surgery or hormones may identify as transsexual.
‘Gender-neutral’ refers to individuals or groups without implying maleness or femaleness.
A ‘eunuch’ is a castrated human male.
The ‘hijra’community is the most common ‘third gender’ in South Asia, though their identity is complex. They are often born male but look and dress in a feminine way. Some hijras are born intersex. Not all prefer the castration ceremony.
Hijras are also known by different names in different communities as Kinnar, Jogtas/Jogappas and Khusras. They number an estimated four million. UP has the most: around 5% of its population.
’Hermaphrodites’have both male and female reproductive organs.
India’s transgender population has a literacy rate of 56.07%, but India has never had a transgender member of parliament.
“In 77 years of independence, we have been fighting to enter Parliament, to empower ourselves,” Rajan Singh, Delhi’s first-ever neuter-gender candidate, told RT. “Our representation is zero because we have never been brought into the mainstream. Even at 1% reservation there would be six of us in the Lok Sabha.”
Singh (26) is a postgraduate degree holder in Hindi Literature. He was estranged from his family after he ‘came out’ young, and has been supported by political activists. “We are treated as untouchable,” Singh says. “People don’t want to touch us, or marry us. There is no facility for us in the education system.”
But most transgender persons don’t fight for their rights because they’re not educated. “The Constitution has given everyone equal rights,” Singh says. “Those rights would get us back our self-esteem and identity. This is a fight for justice, power, and identity.”
Singh claims a threat to life, therefore the court order for police protection, as a rival party is hostile. “They hate us and body-shame us,” Singh says. “How many votes I get would be a stamp on my identity, self-esteem, and the fact that we are alive.”
Durga Bai Majhwar (36) was elected India’s first transgender village head (sarpanch) of Kanhwara in Madhya Pradesh, in 2014. 
“The people persuaded me to fight elections,” Durga tells RT. “The response was warm, people were happy for a third candidate in the fray as they were disappointed with the other two. They got a new face and blessed me because I am a transgender.”
Durga Bai did not attend school or receive a formal education, but believes that won’t stand in the way. Her family has been supportive. “In the village, I tried to address poverty by providing financial support to build houses, toilets and roads, and address drinking water availability,” Durga Bai says.
Mahamandaleshwar Hemangi Sakhi’s reason for contesting the election is her party’s direction. She also contested the 2017 UP assembly polls. “I identify with my party’s political objectives,” Sakhi tells RT. The people’s response, she says, was positive. 
According to reports, Sakhi was appointed Acharya Mahamandaleshwar in February 2019, and honoured with the title of Bhagwatbhushan Mahamandaleshwar by the Akhil Bharatiya Sadhu Samaj (literally, All India Priests Society). Sakhi has also acted in films and on TV.
Sunaina Singh (35) filed the nomination from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, accompanied by nearly a dozen transgender people dancing and singing traditional songs. “I am Dhanbad’s daughter and have massive public support. I know their problems. I will fight for jobs for the third-gender community,” Sunaina told media persons.
This zoology graduate represents the UP-based Naqi Bhartiya Ekta Party (NBEP), and is district president of the ‘Kinnar (transgender) Mas Trust’.

“There are educated people among us with a decent lifestyle. I want to tell society to change its way of looking at us,” Tamanna (35) told RT.
Tamanna is a TV actor who participated in, among other things, the Telugu edition of the Indian reality show ‘Big Boss’. A graduate in Computer Applications, she was the first trans woman to contest assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh in 2019.
The 35-year-old trans woman is overwhelmed with people’s love during the campaign. “I am surprised,” Tamanna says. “People come forward and talk to me.”
She sees change slowly happening. “Those who earlier used to clap hands at traffic signals (to solicit money) have now got jobs at the municipal corporation,” Tamanna says.

The legacy of English jurisprudence caused problems for earlier transgender candidates. Two winners of elections – Kamla Jaan as mayor of Katni, Madhya Pradesh, in 1999; and Asha Devi (born as Amarnath Yadav) as mayor of Gorakhpur, UP, in 2000 – saw their terms ended mid-way when the courts ruled they were originally men and could not win constituencies ‘reserved’ for women. (Reservations of seats in the legislative assemblies, as well as in government jobs and educational institutions are common in India in pursuit of social justice.)
Other early winners included Madhya Pradesh electing the first transgender person, Shabnam Mausi, to the assembly in 2000. Her luck did not hold out when she fought the Kanpur seat in UP in 2012. She again contested the 2018 Madhya Pradesh elections along with five other transgender candidates.
In April 2014, India’s Supreme Court ruled that transgender persons have a right to be legally recognized according to their self-identified gender, including a third gender. Days after the judgment, a transgender person tried for a parliamentary seat. Bharathi Kannamma was the candidate from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state.
Then, Madhu Bai Kinnar, a transgender woman became the first openly transgender mayor in Raigarh in the state of Chhattisgarh, in 2015. In 2019, M Radha contested from Mylapore, Chennai in Tamil Nadu, and again in the 2021 assembly election with the support of crowdfunding but lost.
Five others, including Bhawani Nath Singh Valmiki of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Kajal of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and independent Aswathi Rajappan also contested the 2019 polls. 
In December 2022, a transgender person Bobi was elected to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on an AAP ticket. Devika Akka and Sudha M won in the Karnataka local body elections in 2020. Chithrapu Pushpita Laya from the community was the BSP candidate from Warangal East in Telangana in 2023.
Kalki Subramaniam is an Indian transgender activist, a queer artist, and the founder of Sahodari Foundation, that works for the Indian transgender population. She says political parties are becoming inclusive.
“But they actually give importance to transgender people in the election manifesto only,” Kalki tells RT. “Promises are made but actions are happening slowly or not at all. The struggle is the same, though in some areas it has been better.”
She suggests that governments should focus not solely on giving identity cards and introducing schemes to the queer community, but also on providing legal rights, rehabilitating community members, and making it family-inclusive.
“Many transgender people drop out of school and hence they should get orientation towards entrepreneurship,” Kalki says. “But governments are not into it.”
Having representatives in electoral bodies, she believes, will bring change, and more people from the community should enter politics.

The roots of the revolt against Narendra Modi’s government were visible to anyone who cared to look.
Narendra Modi speaks to members of the media outside the President’s House in New Delhi, India, on Friday, June 7, 2024.
“Ab ki baar, chaar so paar!” Over the last six months, millions of Bharatiya Janata (Indian People’s) Party (BJP) supporters reveled in their party’s official slogan for the 2024 Indian parliamentary elections, bellowing it at rallies and meetings across the country. The phrase roughly translates to “This time around, we’ll get over 400 seats!”—a swaggering proclamation that radiated inevitability.
In the run-up to the election, the BJP’s preening seemed at least somewhat justified. The 400+ goal felt audacious, but always felt possible—at times, even certain. The party’s electoral coalition emerged out of the last parliamentary election in 2019 with 352 seats (303 for the BJP alone)—a powerful mandate in the 543-seat chamber that put 400 seats within close reach. Polls pointed to another decisive victory, giving even more ballast to the slogan. And, most of all, at the helm of the BJP sits Narendra Modi, who’s among the most charismatic, magnetic, and indomitable politicians that India has ever seen.
Much has been written about Modi’s decade as prime minister. His Hindu nationalist politics, which has turned hundreds of millions of Indian Muslims into targets of the state, are well-known, as is his evisceration of Indian civil society. It’s clear what a third consecutive landslide win would have facilitated: an era of unipolar, one-party politics, where Modi’s already significant capture of state institutions would deepen to the extent that BJP machinery became fully indistinguishable from everyday bureaucratic governance. It would have been a tripling down on the repression that has become so normalized throughout Indian society: more opposition political leaders and journalists thrown into jail; more state-sanctioned vigilante violence targeting religious, caste, and cultural minorities; more capture of bureaucratic institutions; and more crackdowns on dissenting speech.
This grim scenario began to seem like a reality on June 1, with the official release of exit polls. Numerous polls promised a remarkable showing for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the electoral coalition headed by the BJP. Almost all of them had the NDA surpassing the 350-seat mark, and some even had the group edging close to 400. All of India’s mainstream news channels (which have effectively devolved into mouthpieces for the BJP) went into a manic frenzy—casting aside any pretense of objectivity and adopting a tone of open celebration. Slowly, the news of the exit polls reached Western media outlets, who rushed to forecast a thumping reelection victory for the prime minister and his party.
But when official vote counts began trickling in on June 4, it became clear that the exit polls had been wildly incorrect (some have even alleged that exit poll manipulation took place). One pollster broke down sobbing on national television over the scale of his firm’s errors.
As it turned out, the BJP wasn’t going to add 100 seats to its coalition. The party was actually hemorrhaging seats across the country—most shockingly, in constituencies across its strongholds in the north in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana. The BJP ultimately lost 63 seats, ending up with 240. For the first time since coming to office in 2014, the party lacked an absolute majority, meaning that it would have to depend on its NDA allies to form a coalition government. Now, the NDA alliance sits at 293 seats. Meanwhile, INDIA, the electoral alliance led by the Congress Party, the left-of-center, secular, national opposition party, exceeded all expectations, netting 246 seats.
The eulogies for Indian democracy delivered in the weeks and months leading to the election now feel premature, even absurd. The Indian democratic project appears more robust and resilient than many people anticipated, and its voters rebuked the illiberal, one-party abyss presented by the BJP. Even though the cult of Modi and the specter of Hindu nationalism remain far from vanquished, they have suffered a significant, historic loss.
Even as Modi’s aura of invincibility remained pristine from afar, some close observers of Indian politics maintained that a landslide reelection victory was far from guaranteed. One point of evidence seemed to be the BJP’s inability to mobilize the grassroots zeal that powered it to victory in the previous two parliamentary elections. While the last two election cycles featured a raucous base of BJP supporters and an energized party machinery, this election season was characterized by a palpable silence, both among voters and Hindu nationalist footsoldiers. But mainstream news outlets, which remained captured by pro-Modi forces, rarely confronted BJP leaders with any serious or rigorous questioning of their party’s organizational difficulties during the campaign.
Historically, the BJP has relied on volunteers from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteer Organization, RSS) to carry out much of the legwork of campaigning. The RSS is a century-old, pan-Indian paramilitary group, influenced by the ideologies of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, that boasts millions of members (some call it the largest volunteer organization in the world) to proselytize the Hindu nationalist cause. The RSS has been implicated in fomenting numerous instances of mob violence over the last seven decades (it’s even been banned from India on three occasions), and it anchors an entire network of Hindu nationalist organizations, including women’s groups, youth groups, labor unions, and overseas chapters. The BJP was spawned out of the RSS as its political wing, and Modi himself has been in the RSS since he was a child.
Modi remains beloved by vast swaths of Hindu nationalists, but his swelling stature has created friction between the BJP and the RSS—the former an organization whose leadership has largely been filled by Modi’s inner circle, and the latter a rigidly ideological organization, whose cultural mission of Hindu supremacy takes precedence over any single individual. Power struggles between the Modi circle and RSS leadership have brewed for years, and spilled out into the open this election season. In an interview conducted last month, BJP President J.P. Nadda, a close Modi ally, shocked political observers when he openly stated what had, until then, been acknowledged only by insinuation: “In the beginning we would have been less capable, smaller and needed the RSS. Today, we have grown and we are capable. The BJP runs itself.”
This lack of grassroots support among party workers and loyalists must also be contextualized with a broader resentment held by rural Indians, especially in the north. Unemployment has soared in recent years; the economy has languished while wealth inequality soars; educational opportunities have dwindled; social welfare systems haven’t been able to deliver as promised. After a full decade in office, there is little room for the prime minister to evade responsibility for the national government’s shortcomings. In many constituencies across India, races became localized referendums on the current state of life in India.
Ever the nimble politician, Modi deployed familiar tactics to try to nationalize the election. Most notably, he injected brazenly majoritarian, anti-Muslim rhetoric into his campaigning. Though his anti-Muslim politics are well-known, Modi as prime minister has typically deployed dog whistles rather than open hate speech—but his tenor shifted sharply during this election season. During one speech in Rajasthan, he chillingly described Muslims as “infiltrators” who “have more children” and accused them of disproportionately collecting government benefits. Days later, during another speech, he accused opposition leaders of performing mujra—a Mughal-era dance historically performed by courtesans—to curry favor with Muslim voters. To some, these crass proclamations could be interpreted as indicating overconfidence, a certainty of victory that allowed him to present his politics entirely unmediated. But to others, this change in tone revealed a new sense of desperation.
Though large portions of the Indian public subscribe to Modi’s breed of Hindu nationalism, for millions of Indians these ideological commitments pale in comparison to the anger elicited by the BJP’s failures to govern. These failures rarely received any media attention from mainstream outlets, which all prostrated to the BJP in portraying the prime minister as both invincible and infallible. Only thanks to the nation’s burgeoning independent-media ecosystem did these sorts of stories get any traction. Modi’s attempt to divert attention away from the material deficiencies of everyday life and toward this greater ideological battle fell flat.
Perhaps the best example of this may be seen in the grand Ram Mandir (RamaTemple) in the north Indian city of Ayodhya, which opened in January of this year. The city has become a site of holy pilgrimage over the last few centuries, owing to the myth that the Hindu deity Rama was born there thousands of years ago. The temple was constructed on the ruins of a mosque destroyed by Hindu nationalist paramilitaries (working in tandem with BJP politicians) in 1992, in an event that helped supercharge the Hindu nationalist political movement. When Modi, the head of state of an ostensibly secular nation, presided over the temple’s consecration in January of this year, hundreds of millions of Indians celebrated. The temple was seen as a grand, shining monument to Modi’s Hindu supremacist India—one that not only legitimated but also sanctified majoritarian mob violence.
On the ground, however, the construction of the temple drew the ire of residents in Ayodhya. Many had their homes seized and destroyed by the government, and were either given meager compensation or lackluster dwellings on the outskirts of the city. The slums that surrounded the temple largely remained undeveloped, and for many locals the temple became a symbol not of a triumphant Hindu identity but of a government preoccupied by its own performance of grandeur, at the expense of the poor. Last week, voters in Ayodhya’s parliamentary constituency shocked the nation when they voted out their BJP representative. Constituencies across India did the same.
This, of course, is just a brief snapshot of certain themes that colored this election—a more complete analysis would consider other factors, such as shifting caste allegiances, evolving party politics at the state and regional levels, and the roles of competing regional and cultural chauvinisms. It will take months, if not years, to sift through the data of the 640 million votes cast—and even then, India is too large and heterogenous for easy answers. “There is no single overarching explanation that would apply to this election,” one analyst has asserted. “Any theory that you’re going to come up with won’t be applicable in a neighboring state.”
But coming out of last week, there are certain things that we can definitively say. For one, even as this rightly feels like a victory for Modi’s opponents, his party remains the strongest force in Indian politics. BJP vote shares spiked in southern states, such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, areas that have historically been resistant to the BJP’s brand of politics but in recent years have received enormous investments from the party—now, they seem poised to break through in those states’ upcoming assembly elections. The BJP also emerged victorious in the eastern state of Odisha, routing the incumbent regional Biju Janata Dal (Biju People’s Party) from Parliament, now holding 20 of the state’s 21 seats. The BJP’s losses in the north (as well as in Maharashtra and West Bengal) shouldn’t necessarily be taken as a rejection of Hindu nationalism. The ideology is alive and well, and will continue its long march throughout the country.

Still, this result is undoubtedly a setback for Modi’s regime, which, for the first time, will have to rely on other parties to stay in power. Modi’s fiat to rule will now have a real check, and his government, with just a 21-seat majority, can’t afford any reckless overreach. One wrong move may cause the departure of coalition allies (most of whom aren’t doctrinal Hindu nationalists), which could humiliatingly topple the NDA government. This dilution of BJP’s mandate should also enable a reinvigoration of Indian civil society, which has languished under a decade of suppression. Activist groups and NGOs have been routinely punished over the last decade for their advocacy, especially when they criticize government policy—this will likely change in a freer political environment. Media outlets, as well, will hopefully feel emboldened to report stories without fear of state reprisal.
Most of all, this electoral performance has punctured Modi’s aura of invincibility. It has given his opponents the confidence to challenge Modi and the BJP head-on. Even as key leaders of the opposing electoral alliance sat in jail on trumped-up charges, and even as Congress Party bank accounts were frozen during the election season, the opposition still managed to put forth a strong performance by drawing attention to the BJP’s failed policies (and tapping into the anti-incumbency sentiments that often attach to governing parties after so many years in power). The opposition coalition, the INDIA Alliance, is a sprawling, unwieldy political configuration, one composed of dozens of parties (many of whom have bitterly fought one another over the years). The INDIA Alliance’s challenge, now, will be to remain united as it proposes an alternative to the hostile, exclusionary consensus championed by the BJP.
A return to the pre-Modi status quo won’t suffice—after all, it’s that status quo that birthed the explosion of strongman Hindu nationalism. Opposition leaders in politics and civil society must go far beyond that and put forth an expansive vision for India that guarantees economic and social justice for all, across caste, class, and religious lines. Indian voters rejected the fatalism that the rest of the world projected onto their nation, and they wrested away their political system from an authoritarian chokehold. Now, the opposition must meet the voters’ mandate.

      Czech-born British playwright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard had aptly noted, “…it’s not the voting that’s democracy. It’s the counting..."". Counting of votes for the Lok Sabha elections is still on, but the current trend so far suggests the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) is all set to form the next government in New Delhi. It is also certain that the government that will be sworn in soon in New Delhi will definitely be a Majboor Sarkar (weak government) rather than a Majboot Sarkar (strong government). Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) founder Kanshiram firmly believed that such a weak government would always be more accountable and answerable towards the people of a developing country like India.

     
      Over the last 10 years that the NDA has been in power, the Opposition—which was in a disarray--has been claiming that the government was going against the very idea of India which has remained multi-lingual, multi-religious and pluralistic in civilizational sense; and a multi-party democracy and federal in constitutional sense. The Hindutva juggernaut, it said, needed to be stopped. And so there emerged a need for alliances of political parties. Such alliances have been successful, as seen in the Bihar Assembly elections in 2015. The very idea of Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) started shaping up against this backdrop. The Janata Dal United, led by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, took the initiative then and found good support from the Congress and Rashtriya Janta Dal, besides the Shiv Sena (led by Udhav Thackeray) the Nationalist Congress Party, the All India Trinamul Congress, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Communist parties.

     
      INDIA was a welcome idea, as unlike in the 2019 parliamentary elections, the opposition parties came together to take on the BJP that had seen its popularity soar and its vote percentage going up to 40%. The 2024 general election is thus unique in the sense that there was an attempt by the Opposition to cobble up a pan-India alliance.

     
      The history of Indian parliamentary democracy shows that there were two attempts by the Opposition to dethrone the ruling party, in 1977 and 1989, respectively. In both cases, the Opposition parties and their leaders were so devoted to their cause that they decided to field a single opposition candidate in each parliamentary seat. INDIA failed miserably on this count. The first jolt came when the JDU decided to part ways with the alliance. Mamata Banerjee led AITC, too, left the fledgling alliance midway. Mayawati-led BSP couldn’t be persuaded to be a part of this alliance. Also, no common minimum programme could be pronounced on behalf of the alliance. Yet, opposition unity was definitely better than in 2019 though it could not muster the support of the electorate to form a government of its own.

     
      The incumbent BJP, on the other hand, started off by setting a high target. The NDA slogan was abki bar char sau paar (400 seats this time) but it seemed to sense the pulse of the people and was pragmatic enough to enter into alliances with political parties such as the JDU and the Telugu Desam Party led by Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh. It also welcomed into its fold parties of lesser significance, including the Shiv Sena faction led by Shinde and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar, Pattali Makkal Katchi of Tamil Nadu and Janata Dal Secular of Karnataka.

     
      It requires no retelling that in the first-past-the-post system, the government is elected by only a minority of its total electorate. So, in 2014, the ruling party’s voter share was close to 31%; in 2019, it was 38%. The estimated vote percentage for BJP for 2024 is again close to 38% even if the NDA vote share would be higher and closer to 40%. This simply indicates that above 60% of the Indian electorate has never extended its mandate to the government.

     
      As for the electoral outcome, Abraham Lincoln had quipped once, ""Elections belong to the people. It's their decision. If they decide to turn their back on the fire and burn their behinds, then they will just have to sit on their blister.""

 A day before counting of votes, Bihar’s Chief Minister Nitish Kumar flew to the national capital to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top BJP leaders to discuss, among other things, the JDU’s potential inclusion in the central government as the NDA’s third consecutive term in power appears certain.
Kumar, whose party JDU is the BJP’s ruling ally in Bihar, met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi early Monday and was scheduled to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah later in the day to discuss political issues in Bihar. However, Kumar, who has been the Chief Minister of Bihar since 2005, reportedly spoke to Shah over the phone as their meeting could not take place.
With the Bihar CM facing health issues, speculation is rife over his future. The JDU, however, stated that Kumar was in Delhi for an eye check-up and had sought time as a routine from Modi and Shah.
Before walking out of the NDA, the JDU had joined the Modi government in 2021 with its leader RCP Singh becoming a Cabinet minister. At that time, the JDU wanted two cabinet berths at the Centre but had to be satisfied with only one slot.
Later, the JDU left the NDA but did a U-turn to become a BJP ally again early this year. The regional party also fought the 2024 Lok Sabha elections as part of the NDA.
This time, there was widespread speculation that one of the key topics of Kumar’s visit was the JDU joining the Modi government.
Interestingly, the JDU is demanding early polls in Bihar which, is in line with the one nation, one election plank of the BJP. The JDU wants assembly elections to be held in Bihar along with other States like Maharashtra and Haryana which are scheduled to seek public mandate later this year. It’s also demanding special status and a special package for the State as a delegation of the Finance Commission is likely to visit Patna on June 10.
Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders, such as party president JP Nadda, Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah, held a meeting on Monday to discuss the party’s performance in the Lok Sabha polls and its preparation for the counting of votes scheduled on Tuesday.
“A meeting was held to discuss and review the elections conducted in seven phases and also to discuss the counting of votes which is to take place tomorrow. The meeting was presided over by party national president J P Nadda,” BJP national general secretary Vinod Tawde told reporters. According to Tawde, voting patterns during all the seven phases of polls were “also reviewed.”
The “Extension discussions” on all seven phases of elections took place in the meeting, attended by BJP national general secretaries and secretaries. Deployment of the party’s polling agents across the country for counting of votes too came up in talks.

Bharti was named minister for law, administrative reforms, and art and culture in the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government, which lasted for just 49 days, after it won the 2013 Delhi Assembly election. The upcoming Lok Sabha election is his maiden contest the general polls.
Bansuri Swaraj, the daughter of former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, is contesting from the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat against AAP's Somnath Bharti. A lawyer by profession, Bansuri was named co-convenor of the party's Delhi legal cell and has become the face of the BJP since last year. Bansuri has been an outspoken critic of Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government for the past year, particularly Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.
Congress, under the seat sharing formula with AAP, has fielded Kanhaiya Kumar from the East Delhi constituency. The former president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU), Kanhaiya Kumar has been noticed for his aggressive campaign and sharp attacks on BJP's Manoj Tiwaro, who is pitted against him. This is Kanhaiya's second encounter with Lok Sabha polls. In 2019, he unsuccessfully contested Bihar's Begusarai seat on a CPI ticket. He joined Congress in 2021.
Manoj Tiwari is the only BJP candidate in Delhi who has been renominated by the saffron party in the Lok Sabha elections this year. His fight is against Kamhaiya Kumar of Congress, making the battle a challenging one. After defeating former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit in the 2019 elections, the Bhojpuri singer and actor, who has represented the constituency for 10 years, earned the nickname ""giant slayer."" He had won by a margin of almost 3,64,000 votes. Tiwari is also the richest candidate in Delhi Lok Sabha elections.
Kuldeep Kumar, a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), will run for the Lok Sabha from the East Delhi seat. In the 2017 Delhi municipal election, the AAP fielded him from the East Delhi ward of Kalyanpuri. At the age of 27, he became the youngest corporator in the MCD. After that, he was named vice president of the AAP's Delhi Unit and leader of the opposition in the East Delhi Municipal Corporation. In 2020, Kumar received another AAP ticket, this time for the Delhi assembly election from the Kondli (East) reserved seat. Raj Kumar of the BJP lost to him by almost 18,000 votes. This time, Kuldeep Kumar faces BJP's Harsh Malhotra.
East Delhi will have a dynamic contest as Kuldeep Kumar will face BJP's Harsh Malhotra, one of the three general secretaries of the Delhi unit of BJP. Malhotra won a seat on the council in 2012, serving as the Welcome ward representative. He later rose to the position of mayor in the East Delhi Municipal Corporation in 2015. At the same time, he became the Chairman of the EDMC Education Committee and served in that capacity for three years.

Rebelo, the deputy editor of Boom Live, a fact-checking publication based in Mumbai, is used to poring over video footage of prominent Indian political figures. But something about this particular recording of the local official, Kamal Nath, wasn’t adding up.
In the 40-second clip, Nath appears to address voters from a pulpit and says that if his party wins the upcoming state elections he plans to end the ladli behna program. The popular state welfare scheme was introduced by the opposing Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP. The comments were more than uncharacteristic, they were suspiciously favorable to the BJP’s election bid.
“I told my teammates there could be only two possibilities: either you have the world’s best impersonator, or you’re using a voice clone,” Rebelo told me on a recent WhatsApp call. “There’s no other third possibility.”
The doctored videos suggested only two scenarios – political parties had a really good voice impersonator or the use of AI voice cloning tech. Most AI audio detection tools online are highly unreliable. These videos were viral when misinfo about Israel-Hamas war exploded. (3/n) pic.twitter.com/Fanc31O0ZO
— Karen Rebelo (@Karen_Rebelo) January 20, 2024

Rebelo theorized that the clip was an audio deepfake: AI-generated audio made to convincingly mimic Nath’s voice. But she didn’t know how to prove it.
“You can no longer solely rely on your human skills as a fact checker,” she said, explaining that standard reporting strategies had fallen short in verifying the video. Synthetic media experts largely agree that the rise of widely accessible generative AI tools over the past two years — across image, audio, and video — has led to a proliferation of political deepfakes. Some of this content is sophisticated enough that a studied human eye, or ear, in combination with ordinary fact-checking methods like a reverse image search or cross-checking details, is simply not enough to debunk it.
Instead, these deepfakes require forensic analysis, often including algorithmic models that can parse through a piece of media to find signs of manipulation. But like many newsrooms in India, Rebelo’s team at Boom Live was hard-pressed to figure out which detection tools were out there and whether they’d be able to access them.
“We didn’t have a very reliable AI audio detection tool at that time. I was looking around for something. I couldn’t find anything that I could completely trust,” Rebelo recalled, remembering several dead ends she encountered running the clip through free tools on the internet. Ultimately, it took Rebelo a few months, plenty of rejected inquiries, and a cold email to the University at Buffalo professor Siwei Lyu, a continent away, to finally find someone who was willing to run a full forensic analysis of the audio clip for free.
According to Lyu’s analysis, the audio of Nath was, in fact, a fake. As were three other clips circling on social media of politicians involved in the Madhya Pradesh state elections. On January 18, Boom Live finally ran its investigation exposing the audio deepfakes. The state election, meanwhile, had been declared over a month earlier.

In recent months, newsrooms across India have been trying to build out a process for deepfake detection. As Boom Live’s Rebelo found, this often requires building relationships with academic researchers, disinformation-focused nonprofits, and developers behind commercial AI detection tools, within India and abroad. A coalition of Indian fact-checking organizations, including Boom Live, launched a WhatsApp hotline in March, called the Deepfakes Analysis Unit, to try and centralize this work of authenticating political media across the country.

The momentum has largely been fueled by anticipation, and concern, around the ongoing Indian general elections. On April 19, voting began in what is expected to be the largest election in history, with over 1 billion people eligible to go to the polls. The election is so large it is split up into several waves, the last of which will take place on June 1. Among the candidates on the ballot is incumbent Prime Minister Modi, a member of the BJP, who is seeking a third term in office.
India may hold the largest election this year, but it is far from the last. In 2024, more than 60 countries will hold major elections and over half of the world’s population will be eligible to go to the polls. In the coming weeks, Mexico and South Africa will host their own general elections, followed closely by the E.U. parliamentary elections. On November 5, the U.S. will go to the polls in a presidential race that is forecasted to, once again, be plagued by election disinformation.
While the current infrastructure for deepfake detection is being pressure tested in India right now, the reporting strategies being carved out by journalists during the election offer a preview into the challenges that lie ahead for other newsrooms around the world.
“Right now it’s manageable, because it’s one [potential deepfake] in a day. What happens when it becomes multiple things in a day? When it becomes multiple on the hour?” wondered Rebelo when we spoke in the days leading up to the first wave of voting. “The challenge will be what happens when it goes nuclear.”
So far in this Indian election cycle, academics studying synthetic media have been a critical resource for reporters like Rebelo. Among them has been Mayank Vatsa’s lab at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Jodhpur. Vatsa started seeing requests for deepfake testing from journalists trickle in last year. Quickly, that influx became a steady stream, with one or two potential deepfakes hitting his inbox every week.
Vatsa soon realized the time it took to sort through those requests and correspond with each journalist alone was unsustainable. In February, he launched Itisaar in collaboration with the Indian startup DigitID. An online web portal, Itisaar allows users to upload files directly and automates parts of the verification process. Currently, individuals can upload files for free. Now, nearly three months into the project, Itisaar is receiving one or two potential deepfakes every hour.
Despite its nascency, the platform already has over 80 approved users and roughly 40% of those are journalists. So far, he says his team has fully evaluated more than 500 submitted samples.

Itisaar can output a simple report that states, up or down, whether a piece of media is a deepfake with a percentage confidence rating. But Vatsa explains journalists often come back to him looking for more granular information, requesting comprehensive reports that they can use to bolster their fact check before running a story.
If an audio clip is one minute long, the Itisaar team can break the clip into four-second segments and mark whether those subclips have been altered. Some of the audio deepfakes they’ve analyzed take real audio recordings and splice in AI-generated segments. “We call this a half-truth,” said Vatsa.
When a journalist submits a video clip, Itisaar can break down the clip by frame and mark where in the video the authentication model is “focusing” while making decisions. If the model is focusing mostly on the lip region, that gives a cue that the mouth has been altered and there’s a very high chance the video is a lip sync, according to Vatsa. If the model focuses on one face in a group, that’s a cue the video is a face swap. “We can get this kind of interpretability, and we provide these attention maps to the journalist,” he said.
When videos of Bollywood actors Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh criticizing Modi went viral the first week of the election, Boom Live used Itisaar to test the clips. From Itisaar’s report they were able to determine the clips were made using a “voice swap,” meaning AI-generated audio had been used to overlay the fake critical comments onto real video footage. The Indian Express, NDTV, Hindustan Times and other major national news outlets aggregated Boom Live’s findings.

There are notable benefits for reporters working with local researchers in India like Vatsa. “The beauty of our approach has been, with respect to audio, that it is multilingual and, with respect to video and images, that it encompasses the diversity of skin tone in the Indian context,” said Vatsa.
One challenge in reporting on election deepfakes in India is language. National newsrooms may have the resources to closely track political disinformation in Hindi, English, or Bengali, but the same often cannot be said for all 22 official languages in India, as well as the more than 120 major regional languages spoken across the country.
Vatsa’s team at IIT Jodhpur, however, has collected a database of 4.1 million audio deepfakes to train its tools. That cuts across Hindi, English, and 13 additional languages spoken on the Indian subcontinent, including Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. The team’s deepfake video dataset, meanwhile, has more than 130,000 samples, mostly depicting Indian people.
RELATED ARTICLEDeepfake detection improves when using algorithms that are more aware of demographic diversitySiwei LyuApril 23, 2024“Data is the new oil, right? What kind of oil are you going to put in your engine?,” asked Vatsa, questioning the efficacy of detection tools that run only on English-language datasets, or that otherwise limit themselves to Western data sources. “That’s the whole game here. If I have to solve the problem, for diversity in language, in a multilingual setting, I have to only put that oil into my engine.”
Vatsa has observed the shortcomings of English-dominated deepfake detection models first hand. Last month, Itisaar received a video through its portal that was in a regional language, one most spoken in a single south Indian state. When the Itisaar team fed the video into its model trained solely on English, it said it was authentic. When they used their standard multilingual model, it correctly identified the video as a deepfake.
“I’m not contesting that a language-agnostic model can be created. Certainly, it can be,” said Vatsa. “But if you have language diversity available to you to train on, then you actually get much better performance, and higher confidence.” Currently, Vatsa claims Itisaar’s models, in almost all 15 languages it is trained on, are registering more than 80% accuracy in detecting deepfakes. In some cases, including Hindi and English, that number rises to 90 to 95%.
“Many of the tools which are available, we don’t know what technology has been used and what kind of diversity the databases have used. But their diversity — the population that they’re looking at — probably is very different from the population that I’m looking at right now,” he said.
While Itisaar is one example of the benefits of a homegrown deepfake detection tool, many reporters in India are, in practice, finding their strongest partnerships with experts abroad.
That includes Nilesh Christopher, an independent journalist based in Bangalore, who has been at the forefront of covering AI-generated political disinformation. (Christopher will also be a 2024–2025 Nieman Fellow.) Most recently, he reported a series of stories for Al Jazeera on the topic, including a piece exposing the rise of AI-generated videos of deceased Indian politicians. They are increasingly being used for posthumous election endorsements. For Wired, Christopher and Varsha Bansal reported that over 50 million AI-generated voice clone calls were made in India in the two months leading up to the elections, as part of an emerging deepfake cottage industry for voter outreach.

— Nilesh Christopher (@NilChristopher) May 20, 2024

In a recent phone call, Christopher echoed other journalists I spoke to — finding reliable detection tools to do this work is not easy. But for Christopher, one reason has been political self-censorship.
“The Indian organizations I reached out to directly wanted to do forensic analysis off record, and tell me about it. None of them wanted to be on-record, fearing political backlash,” he told me, explaining he has encountered this problem with both AI startups and academic research labs in India.
In recent years, political journalists and fact checkers have faced increasing scrutiny and censorship by the Modi government. In 2022, the Delhi police arrested Mohammed Zubair, the founder of the prominent fact checking site Alt News, because of a social media post. More recently, the government has mandated bans of journalists on social media platforms like Twitter and begun the contentious roll-out of a centralized government fact-checking body.
“Once the startups weigh in on a specific political issue, they face the risk of the politician coming after them,” Christopher said. He describes the resistance of local Indian startups to taking on political deepfake checks, particularly on-the-record, as a “systemic issue.” 
“I’m quite confident that none of them would take up detection if it’s a very contentious high-stakes election issue,” he added, imagining an incident that had influence over an election outcome. “That hinders and pushes journalists behind in the news cycle as we try to report the truth.”
For many reporters, gaps in domestic deepfake testing have forced them to regularly seek out expertise overseas. Christopher, for one, has been working closely with Witness, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit that furthers the use of video and technology to defend human rights. Last year, Witness launched its Deepfake Rapid Response Force, an initiative that seeks to help journalists take on some of “the most difficult deepfake cases.”
For one of Christopher’s investigations, published by Rest of World in July 2023, Witness analyzed two audio clips of a politician from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The politician claimed the embarrassing clips — in which he accuses his own party officials of corruption — were AI-generated. The Deepfake Rapid Response Force was able to conduct machine tests and bring in Tamil-speaking experts to review the recordings. Ultimately, one of the clips was deemed real by several sources. The deepfake claim appeared to be a cover to save face.
Services like this, run by Western nonprofits, are critical to journalists reporting on election deepfakes in India right now, according to Christopher. But there are still significant downsides. For one, the full review by the Deepfake Rapid Response Force took about three weeks.
“As someone who is in the Global South, without easy access to these tools, even when organizations like Witness are willing to help, the time lag between when you submit a piece of evidence and you get the result is so far out,” he said, noting that even when checks are expedited, there are few academic or nonprofit partners who can get something turned around in less than a few days.
Academics I spoke to confirmed that they are being inundated with requests from journalists in India, with limited time and resources to take on these pro-bono cases. That means as the election unfolds, there is a constant need to triage which potential deepfakes get prioritized.
“I try to limit that to high-stakes situations,” said Hany Farid, a leading researcher in synthetic media at the University of California, Berkeley, who has worked closely with Indian journalists in recent months. Currently, Farid says his team can only reasonably take on one to two checks per day, despite requests coming in from all over the world.
The lab’s process isn’t as simple as pressing a button; it often requires the team members to customize their forensics approach or run a series of different tests. “I don’t care about the sharks swimming in Central Park after a thunderstorm,” Farid said. “I try to limit myself to the things that I think are impactful and have a bit of a ticking clock.”
But he admits that turnaround times are a chronic challenge facing journalists. “You’ve got a content verification problem, but you also have a speed problem and a volume problem. And arguably, the speed and the volume are really the problem,” he said.
That’s especially concerning because some of the most nefarious election-related deepfakes in the region have been documented in the 48 hours before a major voting day.
In February, an audio clip of Imran Khan, the former prime minister of Pakistan, was released the day before the country’s general election. In the clip, an AI-generated voice mimicking Khan urged voters to boycott the elections, and claimed the vote had been rigged. In that case, the clip was quickly debunked — Khan has been in prison since August of last year.

In January, a similar incident plagued neighboring Bangladesh’s national assembly vote. On election day, two AI-generated videos of independent candidates, in which they appeared to say they were withdrawing from the race and supporting their opposition, began circulating on Facebook.
The incidents beg the question of what will happen in India when a fact check is needed in a matter of hours, not a matter of days or weeks? Amid competition for the limited time of a limited pool of academics, some newsrooms have already turned to commercial detection tools to solve this problem.
Among dozens of free tools, Hive Moderation comes up frequently, since it offers a free dashboard for basic image, audio, and video detection, alongside its money-making enterprise services. AI or Not offers 10 free tests of image files per month before charging kicks in. For audio deepfakes, Eleven Labs, a well-known AI audio generation company, has created its own free detection tool called AI Speech Classifier. It can only be used to confirm whether Eleven Labs itself was used to create a recording, though, and any other audio deepfake will slip beneath its radar.
Earlier this month, OpenAI announced it’s developing a similar detection tool for images generated using Dall-E. The tool has yet to launch. Last year, OpenAI released a similar classifier for AI-generated text, but it was shut down within six months because of its low rate of accuracy.
 “I would prefer academic institutions any day of the week. There’s no question in my head at all, because the quality of the analysis will be far more robust than any commercial tool out there,” said Rebelo. In the past, Boom Live has tried to use free, publicly available AI image detectors, with mixed results. In one case Rebelo had to issue a retraction after a faulty result from an AI image testing service, an experience she calls “scarring.”
Given the limited bandwidth of academics, Boom Live invested in a subscription to Loccus, a tool that detects audio deepfakes and is already widely used in the banking sector to verify the voices of customers, among other use cases. Loccus’ profile has risen quickly, particularly after it entered a partnership with Eleven Labs last fall to build better detection tools.
“We’ve definitely seen a surge in demand this year [from journalists],” said Manel Terraza, the CEO and founder of Loccus. Most small fact-checking organizations, including those in India, have opted for the company’s monthly subscription. For larger media companies, Loccus tends to sell its API, which newsrooms use to service in-house tools that are charged for each minute of audio processed. Locus has signed one such deal with Agence France-Presse (AFP), the French wire service.

Little information about Loccus’ products is available to prospective customers — including its pricing tiers for journalists. Most subscription deepfake detection products on the market, including competitors Reality Defender and Deep Media, require personal consultations before signup. “When you’re building a solution like ours, you need to be very careful around adversarial attacks,” said Terraza, explaining that bad actors could try to use Loccus to reverse engineer deepfakes that evade detection.
Some journalists told me the cost of Loccus, and similar subscription products, can quickly become prohibitive for already bootstrapped newsrooms, or for independent journalists like Christopher. “I met with a couple of websites that promised to give me a response. They were behind paywalls, though, which, again, creates access friction for a journalist on a deadline,” he said.
One solution to these cost problems though has started to emerge among Indian journalists — pooling newsroom resources.
The Misinformation Combat Alliance (MCA) offers one model for how news organizations in India are working together to address both capacity and cost barriers in deepfake detection. Launched in 2022, the MCA currently includes 12 Indian fact-checking organizations among its ranks, including Boom Live, Logically Facts, India Today, and The Quint.
In February, the coalition launched a dedicated WhatsApp tipline called the Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU). The tipline is open to anyone, including journalists, to submit. To subsidize its operating costs, the DAU is receiving direct funding from Meta, which owns WhatsApp and has long been criticized for enabling the flow of political disinformation across India.
The most popular messaging platform in the country, WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, meaning false information can be forwarded from private group chat to private group chat without easy detection. The BJP is reported to operate as many as 5 million WhatsApp groups across the country.
The DAU has hired three full-time editorial staff in India to triage requests that come in on WhatsApp. If the team determines something could be a deepfake, they’ll conduct verification using standard AI detection tools and OSINT techniques. If there are signs of manipulation, that same clip may be passed off to one of the DAU’s forensic partners. That includes deepfake detection labs at academic institutions, like Hany Farid’s lab at UC Berkeley. It also includes the developers of for-profit authentication tools, including IdentifAI and Contrails AI, which send back detailed analysis free of charge.
Currently, the DAU is only servicing video and audio clips in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu, but not images or clips in other regional languages.

“The DAU becomes a sort of central nodal point to coordinate with a lot of different forensic partners. Otherwise, what was happening was all the fact-checkers were reaching out to set up individual partnerships with certain labs and startups. It wasn’t efficient,” said Tarunima Prabhakar, co-founder of the Delhi-based Tattle Civic Technologies, which is a member of the MCA and has been central to launching the DAU tip line.
There are other advantages to newsrooms working as a collective, according to Prabhakar, including bargaining power. “Big AI content-generation companies might not speak to a specific group in India, but as an alliance of 12 fact-checking orgs, they are speaking to us.”
RELATED ARTICLEHow I explained AI and deepfakes using only basic VietnameseLam Thuy Vo, The MarkupApril 29, 2024The same can be said for academics. “We tend to try to work with umbrella groups, like when the AP does a fact-check, hundreds of organizations get that fact check,” said Farid, the Berkeley professor, who mentioned the MCA is among the umbrella organizations he works with closely.
The DAU is also able to offer access to commercial detection tools by proxy. With proper coordination, newsrooms can avoid charges for each testing the same media item by routing their verification through the DAU or reviewing public reports on content the DAU has already tested.
The DAU may not be a silver bullet for spotting deepfakes in India’s complex information ecosystem, but it is one innovative model for cross-industry, cross-newsroom collaboration. It’s also a model that could be replicated by other newsrooms around the world as they navigate deepfake coverage during their own upcoming election cycles.
The challenge of finding deepfakes amongst the deluge of political media circulating in India right now is daunting. The tools used to detect them are new. But the dynamics on the ground are, unfortunately, more than familiar.
“I would argue the bigger story is good old-fashioned social media: Twitter and YouTube, Facebook and TikTok, Telegram and WhatsApp,” said Farid. Political deepfakes can only travel so far without being disseminated across group chats and newsfeeds and For You Pages.
“If you send a deepfake to five of your email friends, I’m not worried. It’s how these deepfakes are not just being allowed on platforms, but being promoted and algorithmically amplified and rewarded and monetized,” he added. “That’s an age-old story there. In fact, it’s not even a generative AI story.”
This story has been corrected to accurately describe the Deepfakes Analysis Unit’s internal verification process.

NEW DELHI, May 18: Bihar has been the only state in the Hindi heartland where the BJP hasn’t ever been able to secure a majority on its own but the 2024 Lok Sabha and the assembly elections next year will unveil the political landscape of the state, says a new book.
In “Broken Promises: Caste, Crime and Politics in Bihar”, Mrityunjay Sharma tells the story of Bihar’s plunge into an abyss of crime, corruption and economic ruin during the tumultuous decade of the 1990s, often referred to as the ‘jungle raj’ years.
Sharma traces the post-Independence socio-politics of Bihar and the momentous events leading up to the ‘90s – the unravelling of long-standing Congress governments, the rise of OBC assertion with Lohiaite politics, the JP movement that put the spotlight on young leaders like Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar, Karpoori Thakur’s reservation formula, the rise of Naxal movements and the entry of socialist governments.
The author says Bihar is the only state in the Hindi heartland where the BJP hasn’t ever been able to secure a majority on its own.
“While in Uttar Pradesh, which at many levels seems similar to Bihar, the BJP has been able to secure decisive mandates in successive elections. The Hindu consolidation that seems to work well in Uttar Pradesh seems to bow down to caste considerations in Bihar,” he says.
He argues that the current uncertainty surrounding Nitish’s future leaves Bihar at a crucial political crossroads.
“The 2024 general elections and 2025 state elections will unveil the political landscape of Bihar, a region that has never succumbed to political complacency,” Sharma says.
According to him, Nitish has long been twisting and tossing to find a comfortable footing in Bihar and national politics and his political challenges seemed no less than his administrative challenges.
He says Nitish strongly believed in the political dictum that you have to be in power first to be able to do anything good.
“It may be the inclination to this principle that led him to concentrate power in himself and thus avoid any dangers to his party and government,” the author claims.
In a state where every regional party associated itself with a particular caste, such as the RJD with Yadavs, the LJP with Paswans, and the JMM with adivasis, Nitish took all possible measures not to be perceived as a Kurmi-centric party, the book, published by Westland, says.
Even later, the new party entrants in Bihar politics such as the RLSP (Rashtriya Lok Samta Party), the VIP (Vikassheel Insaan Party) and the HAM (Hindustani Awam Morcha) would identify themselves with the specific castes of Kushwaha, Mallah and Musahar respectively, it says.
Sharma also writes that Nitish slowly reined in the influence of strong personalities within the party, thus reducing the scope for multiple power centres.
“Unlike its predecessors, the JD(U) never suffered a split and was hardly affected when even significant names such as its Samata Party-founding partner George Fernandes or JD(U)- founding leader Sharad Yadav were shunted out.
“Nitish became both the president of the party as well as the leader of house legislators. Ironically, in this case, he followed all other regional parties in making the JD(U) an individual-centric party. He also made sure that the individual was him,” he adds.
The author says that coalitions have rarely had such longevity as has been seen in Bihar.
“Coalitions are delicately balanced partnerships and depend on a number of factors, such as the relative strengths of parties, overlap and contrast in messaging and vote banks, the electoral advantages of going alone versus as a coalition, and personal equations between senior leaders of the coalition,” he writes.
Sharma says the period from 1990-2005 was a long and tragic one in the recent history of Bihar.
“Ironically, tragedies often make for the most compelling stories. My book is a humble attempt to give the unfamiliar reader a chance to understand what it actually meant to live through the ‘jungle raj’ years of Bihar and how it pushed Bihar forever into the realm of irredeemable ignominy,” he says.

For N Chandrababu Naidu, one of the senior-most politicians in the country, it’s the most relishing success so far. Naidu, who was ruled out by many till a few months ago, has emerged as a key party member in national politics by winning 16 seats in the elections.
In his mid-seventies, when he was reduced to just 23 out of 175 seats in the 2019 elections, everyone thought the game was over for him. It’s not to be. A politician with a never-say-die attitude, Naidu weathered several storms, including an attack by Naxalites in 2002, later defeated by Y S Rajasekhara Reddy in 2024, and a humiliating defeat in the hands of Jagan Mohan Reddy.
All set to bag 80 per cent of the seats in the 175-seat-strong Andhra Pradesh Assembly and 21 seats in Lok Sabha, the NDA alliance in Andhra Pradesh has emerged as the most formidable States for the alliance in the country.
A shrewd politician that he is, Naidu knew well that he couldn’t take on Jagan Mohan Reddy on his own. He allied with film actor Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party, which has huge support among the Kapus, a dominant caste in the State—and convinced the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to let him in the NDA. That was difficult because Naidu had angered Narendra Modi and Amit Shah just before the 2019 elections.
Cut up with his strong criticism, Modi and Amit Shah kept Naidu at arm’s length for over four years. But, it was Naidu who saw the importance of joining the NDA. He saw two advantages – surrogate support from the national law-enforcing agencies and reprieve from the election-time highhandedness at the hands of the State Government.
He had to eat his humble pie and wait for over four days in Delhi along with his Pawan Kalyan. He could finally convince the BJP and join the NDA alliance.
By winning 16 seats in the Lok Sabha, the TDP has emerged as a key player in national politics. For starters, it is not the first time for the TDP to play an important role. From 1999 to 20023, Naidu was A B Vajpayee’s Man Friday. He even influenced the then BJP’s Central leadership that time to go for early polls.
With the NDA alliance winning a slender majority at the Centre, political analysts have already started discussing what role Naidu would play in the formation of the Government. Some even hinted what would happen to the NDA alliance if Chandrababu Naidu and Niteesh Kumar, both belong to the same school of politics, switch loaylties to the INDIA bloc.

The counting today made for a nail-biting experience, with surprises and shocks all through. 
But one aspect that clearly comes out is the fact that by and large people have chosen good candidates over parties, which is quite a positive sign. 
The results have been a mixed bag, wherein some set targets have not been met, while in some cases parties have performed beyond expectations. 
In a nutshell, the people have given an intelligent and well thought-out verdict, and not one based on emotions and favouritism.

There are three welcome developments that have come out of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. One, we now have have a very strong Opposition that has been eluding us for a decade. 
Two, we may have a BJP government that has the chance to benefit from a coalition arrangement. 
Three, as a nation the electorate has attained a maturity that is getting scarcer in even established democracies elsewhere. 
People have authoritatively pushed to the front issues that are at the very core of their concerns. 
This will help the government in a course correction and a retuning of its policies. 
R Narayanan 
Navi Mumbai 

The election results, which were to usher in Modi 3.0, were unexpected. The exaggerated and high pitch campaigns of the political parties have crashed and shocked both NDA and I.N.D.I.A alliances. UP shocked. Even opinion and exit polls lost credibility this time. The governance will undergo a change with focus on the economy, development agenda, industry and job creation. Several minor alliance partners have dissipated. There are several surprises in the defeat of stalwarts. Two assembly election wins of NDA in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh will majorly transform NDA politics.PM Modi faces tough challenges in his third term. Subsequent elections should abandon caste and religious agenda. 
Vinod Johri 
New Delhi 

The results points to clarity in voters’ mind. The winners need not feel elated and the losers need not feel deflated as the margins of victory and defeat were so slender. 
Another message this election result gives is that people in general are not happy with the pro-rich policy that has been pursued in the last 10 years. There is a dire need to care for the middle class who cannot tighten their belts any further. Democracy survives better only in the presence of a strong opposition and absolute power given to any one party leads to authoritarian rule. 
Irrespective of the party that forms the government it is all the more important to keep in mind that enriching the rich, sharpening the communal divide and misusing the government agencies should be done away with. Focusing on employment, taming inflation and bridging the gap between the haves and the haves-not are to be prioritised, to avoid social conflict.

On his campaign trail, Omar Abdullah - a third-generation politician and scion of the first family of Kashmir - is always in a hurry.
The 54-year-old is contesting for a seat in India's parliament from Baramulla in north Kashmir.
With over a million voters to appeal to, Mr Abdullah sets off for 10 hours of gruelling campaigning, trying to reach as many constituents as possible.
As leader of the Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC), he has added responsibility to campaign for other JKNC candidates.
Once the only Muslim-majority state in the country, Kashmir was stripped of its special status on the 5 August 2019.
Its legislative assembly dismissed and the state downgraded to a union territory bringing it directly under the control of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
The move was deeply unpopular with the people.
In an interview at his family home in the town of Gulmarg, Mr Abdullah tells Sky News the special status protections had ""basically safeguarded our identity, it safeguarded our land and our jobs, it safeguarded pretty much our existence"".
In previous elections in India, Prime Minister Modi has campaigned across the country on removing the special status (Article 370) and bringing security to the region.
However, Mr Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have decided not to contest this year's general election there.
Mr Abdullah says: ""A party (BJP) that has contested every election (in Kashmir) since 1996 unsuccessfully, has completely disappeared this time.
""If what (they have) done is so popular, why would (they) not take this opportunity to get (their) candidates in this election?
""Being a Muslim-majority area they would have to field Muslim candidates, which might have sort of affected their narrative in the rest of the country. That's one possibility.
""Or the second is that what they did in 2019 has been deeply unpopular and don't want to be proven through votes.""
Mr Abdullah's campaign is essentially about self-respect, protection of the land and preservation of Kashmiri identity.
Under the special status, property, jobs, scholarships and other privileges were protected for domicile Kashmiris.
The concerns of high unemployment, inflation and cost of living are issues people talk about, but the dominant theme is the loss of Kashmir's distinctive character.
The democratic process that suffered decades of conflict is slowly reviving.

More than 38% voted for the Srinagar seat in Jammu and Kashmir earlier this week - the highest amount in 35 years.
There is enthusiasm among people to participate in campaigns and political rallies.
Political analyst Bashir Manzar says: ""Locals are not stakeholders in decision-making or consulted whenever laws and regulations are being framed. So they feel left out, voiceless, disempowered drastically. This election has given them a chance to come out to say we matter, our voices matter, our aspirations matter.
""Also the influence of militant guns and that leadership which called boycotts and strikes has come down drastically.""

India Elections 2024: Why does voting take so long?
These elections are a test for further democratic exercises, a chance they have grabbed eagerly.
But the jury is out, that anyone associated with Mr Modi's government is shunned and the electors voice that opinion in hush tones - for fear of retribution.
In a market, shopkeeper Abdul Gani says: ""Even if we make a small protest, the next day we will be picked up. Here we have to remain silent. We cannot say anything.""

Another man, Gulam Batt, joins in and says: ""I am speaking to someone like you after many years, I feel there is some normalcy. But I am scared, maybe at night someone will come and say 'you spoke out, come to jail'.""
Waheed Para, 34, a candidate from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who contested the seat in Srinagar, knows the risks too well.
He was imprisoned for years on terror charges and says: ""I'm taking a huge risk when I'm talking to you but then somebody has to stand and take risks to represent our own people.
""We are not doing anything unconstitutional or anti-India. We want the dignity of Kashmiris to be intact.""
Kashmir is symbolic and very significant, a region over which arch-rivals India and Pakistan have fought wars.
It has been called a nuclear flash point. It is one of the most militarised zones in the region.
The elections have also heightened security concerns with more boots on the ground.
It is imperative for the government and election machinery to provide free and fair elections.
""People are feeling suffocated, there is the cycle of silence continuously being here from the last five to six years. This election in a way is an act of healing people,"" Mr Para says.

Kashmiris have grappled with decades of militancy, unrest and betrayal by political regimes in Srinagar and New Delhi that have made them sceptical.

NEW DELHI, June 4: Preparing to take office for a record third consecutive term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday pledged to work with all states, regardless of the party in power, to build a developed India.
In his first speech after the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Modi laid out his vision for the third term saying it would be a tenure of big decisions and key emphasis would be on uprooting corruption.
“The fight against corruption is becoming tougher by the day. Corruption is being shamelessly glorified for political interest. In our third term, NDA will focus a lot on rooting out corruption of all kinds,” Modi said.
Modi’s speech did not refer to its reduced numbers in Parliament but focussed on the “clean sweep” victories in assembly elections as well as Lok Sabha wins in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
Modi also said that the Congress has been wiped out in several states and pointed out that the combined number of seats won by the opposition alliance was less than that of the BJP alone.
Modi’s victory speech at the BJP headquarters, however, was thin on politics and heavy on the future roadmap of his government, which he noted was coming for the third consecutive time, a first in six decades.
“Our Constitution is our guiding light. I want to assure that the Centre will work with all states, irrespective of the party in power there, to work towards our resolve to make India a developed country,” Modi said.
The prime minister arrived at the BJP headquarters to a rousing welcome by hundreds of supporters who chanted ‘Modi, Modi’. He was greeted by BJP President J P Nadda and Union Ministers Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah on the dais.
The backdrop on the stage had ‘Dhanyawad Bharat’ written in various languages, including Urdu.
Modi began his speech with ‘Jai Jagannath’ and thanked the people of Odisha for giving BJP a clear mandate for the first time.
He also thanked TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar — his NDA allies – for the electoral successes in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar. (PTI)

NEW DELHI, June 4: Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which is set to oust the incumbent YSRC in Andhra Pradesh’s state elections, on Tuesday vowed to reinstate Amaravati as the capital city, a plan that was shelved by the outgoing state government.
As of 8.30 pm, the Election Commission data showed TDP winning 102 seats and leading in 32 more in the 175-member assembly, indicating a landslide victory.
“Amaravati is the capital of Andhra Pradesh, there is no second thought about it. It will be developed,” TDP’s senior leader Kanakamedala Ravindrakumar told PTI.
The capital’s location has been a point of contention since Andhra Pradesh’s bifurcation in 2014. Hyderabad was made the common capital for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh until June 2, 2024, under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act.
YSRC chief and outgoing Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy’s plan to establish three state capitals, moving away from Amaravati, faced legal challenges.
Ravindrakumar accused the YSRC government of stalling Amaravati’s construction and other projects initiated by TDP’s N Chandrababu Naidu.
He also alleged human rights violations by the YSRC.The election results suggest a strong endorsement of TDP’s development agenda. (PTI)

There are two ways of trying to understand the June 2024 general election results: figuring out the meaning of the verdict, or the reasons for the BJP’s underwhelming performance; and its consequences for the new government. In the absence of sufficient information, it is hard to pinpoint the broader forces that have dragged the BJP below the majority mark.
But some surmises can be made: a sense of hubris; a feeling that a huge majority for the BJP could lead to the Constitution being fundamentally changed, taking away quotas for the dalits and OBCs; dissatisfaction over inflation and unemployment; a reaction to the promotion of personality cult using State resources; the perception regarding use of State power to browbeat political opponents; an attempt to steamroller regional parties; and maybe, an overdose of religious messaging and innuendo. 
It will take some time to figure out which forces were at work, and in what measure. 
But the results per se tell us a few things. First, the BJP’s loss has been the Congress’ gain. Congress had fared poorly in a straight contest against the BJP in the last two general elections. Therefore, the performance of the Congress this time should bolster its confidence in upcoming Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana. 

Second, the regional parties have held their own against the BJP juggernaut, with the exception of the Biju Janata Dal, whose loss in both the general and Assembly polls seems to be a straightforward case of anti-incumbency. 
The election, characterised by the good show by DMK, Telugu Desam, NCP-Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray), Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party, marks a pushback against a homogenising force. Many of these parties came into being in the 1980s and 1990s to counter the centralising, anti-democratic tendencies of the Congress party at that time. Now, the wheel has come full circle, with the BJP being perceived in a somewhat similar way to the Congress of yesteryear — as a threat to regional forces. 
In contrast to the BJP under Atal Behari Vajpayee, there are more regional parties against the BJP today than those with it. It is worth asking whether the BJP central leadership has paid a price for being too pushy and meddlesome with its erstwhile alliance partners. 
This regionalist pushback marks a federal assertion against central policies, which should make the BJP strategists wonder whether its slogan of ‘double-engine ki sarkar’ in Assembly elections has been well received. To many, it would seem like the Centre trying to be the boss. 
This pushback seems pronounced in Maharashtra, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The BJP brought the Maharashtra debacle upon itself by doing an ‘Operation Kamal’ there — bringing down the Maha Vikas Agadi government and triggering a split in the Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena. Its alliance partners in Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar became liabilities for the BJP, whereas Uddhav Thackeray benefited politically from his clumsy ouster. 
The reasons for TMC surpassing its 2019 performance could be State-specific. Tamil Nadu’s result could be influenced by familiar socio-cultural undercurrents. 
The BJP has also benefited in certain States due to local factors. It has reaped the benefits of anti-incumbency in Odisha. Its ally, Telugu Desam, has done the same in Andhra Pradesh. It should be a cause of some satisfaction to the BJP, and perhaps even the Congress, that Aam Aadmi Party, has not fared well in Delhi and Punjab. 
The Congress might have nearly doubled its tally, but its performance in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and to an extent Telangana, where it is in power, should be a cause for concern — just as it can derive some satisfaction from its results in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. 
The mood shift in India’s biggest State, Uttar Pradesh, will be a subject of discussion for sometime. 
The BJP will have some introspection to do on what went wrong. A quiet churn within the party cannot be ruled out. 
A coalition government is a certainty. This is likely to balance Centre-State power. Its effects on policymaking are likely to be positive. 
Decisions will be marked by more deliberation and negotiation. India’s post-1990 experience with coalition governments has been quite positive. The virtues of ‘absolute majority’ are certainly overblown, as coalitions bring with them their own checks and balances, so essential in a democracy. 
A return to sober governance, sans over-the-top ideological messaging and hyper-narratives, is perhaps what the people really want and need.

No one knows why the Hohokam Indians vanished. They had carved hundreds of miles of canals in the Sonoran Desert with stone tools and channeled the waters of the Salt and Gila Rivers to irrigate their crops for a thousand years until, in the middle of the 15th century, because of social conflict or climate change—drought, floods—their technology became obsolete, their civilization collapsed, and the Hohokam scattered. Four hundred years later, when white settlers reached the territory of southern Arizona, they found the ruins of abandoned canals, cleared them out with shovels, and built crude weirs of trees and rocks across the Salt River to push water back into the desert. Aware of a lost civilization in the Valley, they named the new settlement Phoenix.

It grew around water. In 1911, Theodore Roosevelt stood on the steps of the Tempe Normal School, which, half a century later, would become Arizona State University, and declared that the soaring dam just completed in the Superstition Mountains upstream, established during his presidency and named after him, would provide enough water to allow 100,000 people to live in the Valley. There are now 5 million.
The Valley is one of the fastest-growing regions in America, where a developer decided to put a city of the future on a piece of virgin desert miles from anything. At night, from the air, the Phoenix metroplex looks like a glittering alien craft that has landed where the Earth is flat and wide enough to host it. The street grids and subdivisions spreading across retired farmland end only when they’re stopped by the borders of a tribal reservation or the dark folds of mountains, some of them surrounded on all sides by sprawl.
Phoenix makes you keenly aware of human artifice—its ingenuity and its fragility. The American lust for new things and new ideas, good and bad ones, is most palpable here in the West, but the dynamo that generates all the microchip factories and battery plants and downtown high-rises and master-planned suburbs runs so high that it suggests its own oblivion. New Yorkers and Chicagoans don’t wonder how long their cities will go on existing, but in Phoenix in August, when the heat has broken 110 degrees for a month straight, the desert golf courses and urban freeways give this civilization an air of impermanence, like a mirage composed of sheer hubris, and a surprising number of inhabitants begin to brood on its disappearance.
Growth keeps coming at a furious pace, despite decades of drought, and despite political extremism that makes every election a crisis threatening violence. Democracy is also a fragile artifice. It depends less on tradition and law than on the shifting contents of individual skulls—belief, virtue, restraint. Its durability under natural and human stress is being put to an intense test in the Valley. And because a vision of vanishing now haunts the whole country, Phoenix is a guide to our future.
Among the white settlers who rebuilt the Hohokam canals were the Mormon ancestors of Rusty Bowers. In the 1890s, they settled in the town of Mesa, east of Phoenix and a few miles downstream from where the Verde River joins the Salt. In 1929, when Bowers’s mother was a little girl, she was taken to hear the Church president, believed to be a prophet. For the rest of her life, she would recall one thing he told the assembly: “I foresee the day when there will be lines of people leaving this valley because there is no water.”
The Valley’s several thousand square miles stretch from Mesa in the east to Buckeye in the west. Bowers lives on a hill at Mesa’s edge, about as far east as you can go before the Valley ends, in a pueblo-style house where he and his wife raised seven children. He is lean, with pale-blue eyes and a bald sunspotted head whose pinkish creases and scars in the copper light of a desert sunset give him the look of a figure carved from the sandstone around him. So his voice comes as a surprise—playful cadences edged with a husky sadness. He trained to be a painter, but instead he became one of the most powerful men in Arizona, a 17-year state legislator who rose to speaker of the House in 2019. The East Valley is conservative and so is Bowers, though he calls himself a “pinto”—a spotted horse—meaning capable of variations. When far-right House members demanded a 30 percent across-the-board budget cut, he made a deal with Democrats to cut far less, and found the experience one of the most liberating of his life. He believes that environmentalists worship Creation instead of its Creator, but he drives a Prius as well as a pickup.
In the late 2010s, the Arizona Republican Party began to worry Bowers with its growing radicalism: State meetings became vicious free-for-alls; extremists unseated mainstream conservatives. Still, he remained a member in good standing—appearing at events with Donald Trump during the president’s reelection campaign, handing out Trump flyers door-to-door—until the morning of Sunday, November 22, 2020.
Bowers and his wife had just arrived home from church when the Prius’s Bluetooth screen flashed WHITE HOUSE. Rudy Giuliani was calling, and soon afterward the freshly defeated president came on the line. As Bowers later recalled, there was the usual verbal backslapping, Trump telling him what a great guy he was and Bowers thanking Trump for helping with his own reelection. Then Giuliani got to the point. The election in Arizona had been riddled with fraud: piles of military ballots stolen and illegally cast, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens and dead people voting, gross irregularities at the counting centers. Bowers had been fielding these stories from Republican colleagues and constituents and found nothing credible in them.
“Do you have proof of that?” Bowers asked.
“Yeah,” Giuliani replied.
“Do you have names?”
“Oh yeah.”
“I need proof, names, how they voted, and I need it on my desk.”
“Rudy,” Trump broke in, “give the man what he wants.”
Bowers sensed some further purpose to the call. “To what end? What’s the ask here?”
“Rudy, what’s the ask?” Trump echoed, as if he didn’t know.
America’s ex-mayor needed Bowers to convene a committee to investigate the evidence of fraud. Then, according to an “arcane” state law that had been brought to Giuliani’s attention by someone high up in Arizona Republican circles, the legislature could replace the state’s Biden electors with a pro-Trump slate.
The car was idling on the dirt driveway by a four-armed saguaro cactus. “That’s a new one,” Bowers said. “I’ve never heard that one before. You need to tell me more about that.”
Giuliani admitted that he personally wasn’t an expert on Arizona law, but he’d been told about a legal theory, which turned out to have come from a paper written by a 63-year-old state representative and avid Trump partisan named Mark Finchem, who was studying for a late-in-life master’s degree at the University of Arizona.
“We’re asking you to consider this,” Trump told Bowers.
“Mr. President …”
Bowers prayed a lot, about things large and small. But prayer doesn’t deliver instant answers. So that left conscience, which everyone is blessed with but some do their best to kill. An immense number of Trump-era Republican officeholders had killed theirs in moments like this one. Bowers, who considered the Constitution divinely inspired, felt his conscience rising up into his throat: Don’t do it. You’ve got to tell him you won’t do it.
“I swore an oath to the Constitution,” Bowers said.
“Well, you know,” Giuliani said, “we’re all Republicans, and we need to be working together.”
“Mr. President,” Bowers said, “I campaigned for you. I voted for you. The policies you put in did a lot of good. But I will do nothing illegal for you.”
“We’re asking you to consider this,” Trump again told Bowers.
At the end of November, Trump’s legal team flew to Phoenix and met with Republican legislators. Bowers asked Giuliani for proof of voter fraud. “We don’t have the evidence,” Giuliani said, “but we have a lot of theories.” The evidence never materialized, so the state party pushed the theories, colleagues in the legislature attacked Bowers on Twitter, and a crowd swarmed the capitol in December to denounce him. One of the most vocal protesters was a young Phoenix man a month away from world fame as the QAnon Shaman.
On December 4, Bowers wrote in his diary:
Caravans of trucks climbed the road to Bowers’s house with pro-Trump flags and video panels and loudspeakers blasting to his neighbors that he was corrupt, a traitor, a pervert, a pedophile. His daughter Kacey, who had struggled with alcoholism, was now dying, and the mob outside the house upset her. At one point, Bowers went out to face them and encountered a man in a Three Percenter T-shirt, with a semiautomatic pistol on his hip, screaming abuse. Bowers walked up close enough to grab the gun if the Three Percenter drew. “I see you brought your little pop gun,” he said. “You gonna shoot me? Yell all you want—don’t touch that gun.” He knew that it would take only one would-be patriot under the influence of hateful rhetoric to kill him. He would later tell the January 6 congressional committee: “The country is at a very delicate part where this veneer of civilization is thinner than my fingers pressed together.”
Emails poured in. On December 7, someone calling themselves hunnygun wrote:
Three days before Christmas, Bowers was sitting on his patio when Trump called again—this time without his attorney, and with a strange message that might have been an attempt at self-exculpation. “I remember what you told me the last time we spoke,” Trump said. Bowers took this as a reference to his refusal to do anything illegal, which he repeated. “I get it,” Trump said. “I don’t want you to.” He thanked Bowers for his support during the campaign. “I hope your family has a merry Christmas.”
Kacey Bowers died at age 42 on January 28, 2021. COVID rules kept the family from her hospital bedside until her final hours. Bowers, a lay priest in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, gave his daughter a blessing, and at the very end, the family sang a hymn by John Henry Newman:
The gloom thickened. Bowers’s enemies launched an effort to recall him, with foot soldiers provided by the Trump youth organization Turning Point USA, which is headquartered in Phoenix. The recall failed, but it was an ill omen. That summer, a wildfire in the mountains destroyed the Bowers ranch, taking his library, his papers, and many of his paintings. In 2022, after Bowers testified before the January 6 committee in Washington, D.C., the state party censured him and another stream of abuse came to his doorstep. Term-limited in the House, he ran for a Senate seat just to let the party know that it couldn’t bully him out. He was demolished by a conspiracist with Trump’s backing. Bowers’s political career was over.
“What do you do?” Bowers said. “You stand up. That’s all you can do. You have to get back up. When we lost the place and saw the house was still burning and now there’s nothing there, gone, and to have 23-plus years of a fun place with the family to be gone—it’s hard. Is it the hardest? No. Not even close. I keep on my phone (I won’t play it for you) my last phone call from my daughter—how scared she was, a port came out of her neck, they were transporting her, she was bleeding all over, and she says: ‘Dad, please, help me, please!’ Compared to a phone call from the president, compared to your house burning down? So what? What do you do, Dad? Those are hard things. But they come at us all. They’re coming at us as a country … What do we do? You get up.”
Bowers went back to painting. He took a job with a Canadian water company called EPCOR. Water had obsessed him all his life—he did not want the prophet’s vision to come to pass on his watch. One bright day last October, we stood on the Granite Reef Diversion Dam a few miles from his house, where the two main water systems that nourish the Valley meet at the foot of Red Mountain, sacred to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indians, whose reservation stood just across the dry bed of the river. Below the dam’s headgate three-foot carp thrashed in the turbulent water of the South Canal, and wild horses waded in the shallows upstream.
“What’s the politics of water here?” I asked.
Bowers laughed, incredulous. “Oh my gosh, that question. It’s everywhere. You’ve heard the dictum.”
I had heard the dictum from everyone in the Valley who thought about the subject. “Whiskey’s for drinking—”
“Water’s for fighting,” Bowers finished, and then he amended it: “Water’s for killing.”
Summer in the Valley for most of its inhabitants is like winter in Minnesota—or winter in Minnesota 20 years ago. People stay inside as much as possible and move only if absolutely necessary among the artificial sanctuaries of home, car, and work. Young professionals in the arts district emerge after dark to walk their dogs. When the sun is high, all human presence practically disappears from the streets, and you notice how few trees there are in Phoenix.
Frank Lloyd Wright disliked air-conditioning. During a visit to Taliesin West, the home and studio he built from desert stone in the 1930s on a hillside north of Phoenix, I read in his book The Natural House :
The observation gets at the unnaturalness of the Valley, because its civilization is unthinkable without air-conditioning. But the massive amount of energy required to keep millions of people alive in traffic jams is simultaneously burning them up, because air-conditioning accounts for 4 percent of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions, twice that of all aviation.
One morning last August, goaded by Wright and tired of air-conditioned driving, I decided to walk the mile from my hotel to an interview at the Maricopa County Recorder’s Office. Construction workers were sweating and hydrating on the site of a new high-rise. A few thin figures slouched on benches by the Valley Metro tracks. At a bus shelter, a woman lay on the sidewalk in some profound oblivion. After four blocks my skin was prickling and I thought about turning back for my rental car, but I couldn’t face suffocating at the wheel while I waited for the air to cool. By the time I reached the Recorder’s Office, I was having trouble thinking, as if I’d moved significantly closer to the sun.
Last summer—when the temperature reached at least 110 degrees on 55 days (above 110, people said, it all feels the same), and the midsummer monsoon rains never came, and Phoenix found itself an object of global horror—heat officially helped kill 644 people in Maricopa County. They were the elderly, the sick, the mentally ill, the isolated, the homeless, the addicted (methamphetamines cause dehydration and fentanyl impairs thought), and those too poor to own or fix or pay for air-conditioning, without which a dwelling can become unlivable within an hour. Even touching the pavement is dangerous. A woman named Annette Vasquez, waiting in line outside the NourishPHX food pantry, lifted her pant leg to show me a large patch of pink skin on her calf—the scar of a second-degree burn from a fall she’d taken during a heart attack in high heat after seven years on the streets.
Read: The problem with ‘Why do people live in Phoenix?’
It was 115 on the day I met Dr. Aneesh Narang at the emergency department of Banner–University Medical Center. He had already lost four or five patients to heatstroke over the summer and just treated one who was brought in with a body temperature of 106 degrees, struggling to breathe and unable to sweat. “Patients coming in at 108, 109 degrees—they’ve been in the heat for hours, they’re pretty much dead,” Narang said. “We try to cool them down as fast as we can.” The method is to strip off their clothes and immerse them in ice and tap water inside a disposable cadaver bag to get their temperature down to 100 degrees within 15 or 20 minutes. But even those who survive heatstroke risk organ failure and years of neurological problems.
Recently, a hyperthermic man had arrived at Narang’s emergency department lucid enough to speak. He had become homeless not long before and was having a hard time surviving in the heat—shelters weren’t open during the day, and he didn’t know how to find the city’s designated cooling centers. “I can’t keep up with this,” he told the doctor. “I can’t get enough water. I’m tired.”
Saving a homeless patient only to send him back out into the heat did not feel like a victory to Narang. “It’s a Band-Aid on a leaking dam,” he said. “We haven’t solved a deep-rooted issue here. We’re sending them back to an environment that got them here—that’s the sad part. The only change that helps that situation is ending homelessness. It’s a problem in a city that’ll get hotter and hotter every year. I’m not sure what it’ll look like in 2050.”
The mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego, has a degree in environmental science and has worked on water policy in the region. “We are trying to very much focus on becoming a more sustainable community,” she told me in her office at city hall. Her efforts include the appointment of one of the country’s first heat czars; zoning and tax policies to encourage housing built up rather than out (downtown Phoenix is a forest of cranes); a multibillion-dollar investment in wastewater recycling; solar-powered shipping containers used as cooling centers and temporary housing on city lots; and a shade campaign of trees, canopies, and public art on heavily walked streets.
But the homeless population of metro Phoenix has nearly doubled in the past six years amid a housing shortage, soaring rents, and NIMBYism; multifamily affordable housing remain dirty words in most Valley neighborhoods. Nor is there much a mayor can do about the rising heat. A scientific study published in May 2023 projected that a blackout during a five-day heat wave would kill nearly 1 percent of Phoenix’s population—about 13,000 people—and send 800,000 to emergency rooms.
Near the airport, on the treeless streets south of Jefferson and north of Grant, there was a no-man’s-land around the lonely tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad, with scrap metal and lumber yards, stacks of pallets, a food pantry, abandoned wheelchairs, tombstones scattered across a dirt cemetery, and the tents and tarps and belongings and trash of the homeless. I began to think of this area, in the dead center of the Valley, as the heat zone. It felt hotter than anywhere else, not just because of the pavement and lack of shade, but because this was where people who couldn’t escape the furnace came. Most were Latino or Black, many were past middle age, and they came to be near a gated 13-acre compound that offered meals, medical and dental care, information about housing, a postal address, and 900 beds for single adults.
Last summer, the homeless encampment outside the compound stretched for several desolate blocks—the kind of improvised shantytown I’ve seen in Manila and Lagos but not in the United States, and not when the temperature was 111 degrees. One day in August, with every bed inside the compound taken, 563 people in varying states of consciousness were living outside. I couldn’t understand what kept them from dying.
Read: When will the Southwest become unlivable?
Mary Gilbert Todd, in her early 60s, from Charleston, South Carolina, had a cot inside Respiro, a large pavilion where men slept on one side, women on the other. Before that she’d spent four years on the streets of Phoenix. Her face was sunburned, her upper teeth were missing, and she used a walker, but her eyes gleamed bright blue with energy.
“If you put a wet shirt on and wet your hair, it’s gonna be cool,” she told me cheerfully, poking with a fork at a cup of ramen. “In the daytime, you don’t wanna walk. It’s better, when you’re homeless, to find a nice, shady tree and build yourself a black tent that you can sleep in where there’s some breeze. The black, it may absorb more heat on the outside, but it’s going to provide more shade. Here you got the dry heat. You want to have an opening so wind can go through—something that the police aren’t going to notice too much. Because if you’re in a regular tent, they’re gonna come bust you, and if you’re sitting out in the open, they’re gonna come mess with you.” She said that she’d been busted for “urban camping” 600 times.
My guide around the compound was Amy Schwabenlender, who directs it with the wry, low-key indignation of a woman working every day in the trenches of a crisis that the country appears readier to complain about than solve. “It’s America—we don’t have to have homelessness,” she said. “We allow homelessness to happen. We—the big we.” The neighbors—a casket maker, an electric-parts supplier, the owners of a few decaying houses—blamed Schwabenlender for bringing the problem to their streets, as if she were the root cause of homelessness. In the face of a lawsuit, the city was clearing the encampment.
Schwabenlender had come to the Valley to get away from depressing Wisconsin winters. After her first night in a motel in Tempe, she went out to her car and found the window heat-glued to the door by its rubber seal. “What did I just do to myself?” she wondered. Now she lives in North Phoenix in a house with a yard and a pool, but she has seen enough misery to be a growth dissident.
“I don’t know why people want to live here,” she said, smiling faintly, her pallor set off by thick black hair. “We can’t have enough housing infrastructure for everyone who wants to live here. So why are we celebrating and encouraging more business? Why are we giving large corporations tax breaks to move here? How can we encourage people to come here when we don’t have enough housing for the people who are here, and we don’t have enough water? It doesn’t add up to me.”
While we were talking, a woman with a gray crew cut who was missing her left leg below the thigh rolled up to Schwabenlender in a wheelchair. She had just been released after a long prison term and had heard something that made her think she’d get a housing voucher by the end of the month.
Schwabenlender gave an experienced sigh. “There’s a waitlist of 4,000,” she told the woman.
On my way out of Respiro, I chatted with a staff member named Tanish Bates. I mentioned the woman I’d seen lying on the sidewalk by the bus shelter in the heat of the day—she had seemed beyond anyone’s reach. “Why didn’t you talk to her?” Bates asked. “For me, it’s a natural instinct—I’m going to try. You ask them, ‘What’s going on? What do you need? Do you need water? Should I call the fire department?’ Nothing beats failure but a try.” She gave me an encouraging pat. “Next time, ask yourself what you would want.”
Utterly shamed, I walked out into the heat zone. By the compound’s gate, a security guard stood gazing at the sky. A few lonely raindrops had begun to fall. “I been praying for rain,” she said. “I am so tired of looking at the sun.” People were lining up to spend an hour or two in a city cooling bus parked at the curb. Farther down Madison Street, the tents ended and street signs announced: THIS AREA IS CLOSED TO CAMPING TO ABATE A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
Every time I returned to Phoenix, I found fewer tents around the compound. The city was clearing the encampment block by block. In December, only a few stragglers remained outside the gate—the hardest cases, fading out on fentanyl or alert enough to get into fights. “They keep coming back,” said a skinny, shirtless young man named Brandon Bisson. “They’re like wild animals. They’ll keep coming back to where the food and resources are.” Homeless for a year, he was watering a pair of healthy red bougainvillea vines in front of a rotting house where he’d been given a room with his dog in exchange for labor. Bisson wanted a job working with animals.
“There’s no news story anymore,” Schwabenlender said as she greeted me in her office. The city had opened a campground where 15th Avenue met the railroad tracks, with shipping containers and tents behind screened fencing, and 41 people were now staying there. Others had been placed in hotels. But it was hard to keep tabs on where they ended up, and some people were still out on the street, in parks, in cars, under highway overpasses. “How do we keep the sense of urgency?” Schwabenlender murmured in her quizzical way, almost as if she were speaking to herself. “We didn’t end homelessness.” The housing waitlist for Maricopa County stood at 7,503. The heat was over for now.
Civilization in the Valley depends on solving the problem of water, but because this has to be done collectively, solving the problem of water depends on solving the problem of democracy. My visits left me with reasons to believe that human ingenuity is equal to the first task: dams, canals, wastewater recycling, underground storage, desalination, artificial intelligence. But I found at least as many reasons to doubt that we are equal to the second.
It’s easy to believe that the Valley could double its population when you’re flying in a helicopter over the dams of the Salt River Project, the public utility whose lakes hold more than 2 million acre-feet—650 trillion gallons—of water; and when Mayor Gallego is describing Phoenix’s multibillion-dollar plan to recycle huge quantities of wastewater; and when Stephen Roe Lewis, the leader of the Gila River Indian Community, is walking through a recharged wetland that not long ago had been barren desert, pointing out the indigenous willows and cattails whose fibers are woven into traditional bracelets like the one around his wrist.
But when you see that nothing is left of the mighty Colorado River as it approaches the Mexican border but dirt and scrub; and when you drive by a road sign south of the Valley that says EARTH FISSURES POSSIBLE because the water table is dropping four feet a year; and when sprinklers are watering someone’s lawn in Scottsdale in the rain—then the prophet’s vision feels a little closer.
American sprawl across the land of the disappeared Hohokam looks flimsy and flat and monotonous amid the desert’s sublime Cretaceous humps. But sprawl is also the sight of ordinary people reaching for freedom in 2,000 square feet on a quarter acre. Growth is an orthodox faith in the Valley, as if the only alternative is slow death.
Once, I was driving through the desert of far-northern Phoenix with Dave Roberts, the retired head of water policy for the Salt River Project. The highway passed a concrete fortress rising in the distance, a giant construction site with a dozen cranes grasping the sky. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s three plants would employ 6,000 people; they would also consume billions of gallons of Phoenix’s water every year. Roberts filled in the empty space around the site: “All this desert land will be apartments, homes, golf courses, and who knows what—Costcos. There’s going to be malls out here. Gobs of people.” As long as people in places like Louisiana and Mississippi wanted to seek a better life in the Valley, who was he to tell them to stay away? A better life was the whole point of growth.
I asked Roberts, an intensely practical man, if he ever experienced apocalyptic visions of a dried-up Valley vanishing.
“We have three things that the Hohokam didn’t,” he said—pumping, storage (behind dams and underground), and recycling. When I mentioned this to Rusty Bowers, I couldn’t remember the third thing, and he interjected: “Prayer.” I offered that the Hohokam had probably been praying for water too. “I bet they were,” Bowers said. “And the Lord says, ‘Okay. I could go Bing! But that’s not how I work. Go out there and work, and we’ll figure this thing out together.’ ”
This famously libertarian place has a history of collective action on water. Thanks to the bipartisan efforts of the 20th century—the federal dams built in the early 1900s; the 330-mile canal that brought Colorado River water to the Valley in the late 20th century; a 1980 law regulating development in Arizona’s metro regions so they’d conserve groundwater, which cannot be replaced—Phoenix has a lot of water. But two things have happened in this century: a once-in-a-millennium drought set in, and the political will to act collectively dried up. “The legislature has become more and more partisan,” Kathleen Ferris, an architect of the 1980 law, told me. “And there’s a whole lot of denial.”
At some point, the civilization here stopped figuring this thing out together. The 1980 groundwater law, which required builders in regulated metro areas like the Valley to ensure a 100-year supply, left groundwater unregulated in small developments and across rural Arizona. In the mid-1990s, the legislature cut loopholes into the 100-year requirement. The God-given right to pursue happiness and wealth pushed housing farther out into the desert, beyond the reach of the Valley’s municipal water systems, onto groundwater. In the unregulated rural hinterland, megafarms of out-of-state and foreign agribusinesses began to pump enormous quantities of groundwater. The water table around the state was sinking, and the Colorado River was drying up.
Ferris imagined a grim future. Without new regulation, she said, “we will have land subsidence, roads cracking, destroying infrastructure, and in some cases people’s taps going dry.” The crisis wouldn’t hit the water-rich Phoenix metroplex first. “It’s going to be on the fringes, and all the people who allowed themselves to grow there are going to be really unhappy when they find out there’s no water.”
Most people in the Valley come from somewhere else, and John Hornewer came from Chicago. One summer in the early 1990s, when he was about 25, he went for a hike in the Hellsgate Wilderness, 75 miles northeast of Phoenix, and got lost. He ran out of water and couldn’t find a stream. When he grew too weak to carry his backpack, he abandoned it. His eyes began to throb; every muscle hurt; even breathing hurt. He sank to his knees, his face hit the ground, and as the flies buzzed around he thought: Just stop my heart. He was saved by campers, who found him and drove him the 20 miles he’d wandered from his car.
Almost dying from dehydration changed Hornewer’s life. “I take water very seriously,” he told me. “I’m passionate about water.”
In the late ’90s, Hornewer and his wife bought two and a half acres several miles up a dirt road in Rio Verde Foothills, a small community on the northeastern edge of the Valley. To the southwest, the city of Scottsdale ends and unincorporated Maricopa County starts where the golf courses give way to mesquite and the paved roads turn to dirt. Over the years, the desert around the Hornewers was filled in by people who wanted space and quiet and couldn’t afford Scottsdale.
Seeing a need, Hornewer started a business hauling potable water, filling his 6,000-gallon trucks with metered water at a Scottsdale standpipe and selling it to people in Rio Verde with dry wells or none at all. What kept Rio Verde cheaper than Scottsdale was the lack of an assured water supply. Wildcat builders, exploiting a gap in the 1980 law, didn’t tell buyers there wasn’t one, or the buyers didn’t ask. Meanwhile, the water table under Rio Verde was dropping. One of Hornewer’s neighbors hit water at 450 feet; another neighbor 150 feet away spent $60,000 on a 1,000-foot well that came up dry.
Hornewer wears his gray hair shoulder-length and has the face of a man trying to keep his inherent good nature from reaching its limit. In the past few years, he began to warn his Rio Verde customers that Scottsdale’s water would not always be there for them, because it came to Scottsdale by canal from the diminishing Colorado River. “We got rain a couple of weeks ago—everything’s good!” his customers w",,,

“This victory is clear in the election results.”
 Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Shambhavi Choudhary has won Bihar’s Samastipur Lok Sabha seat becoming one of the youngest MPs. “I extend my wishes to the people of Samastipur. I would say that they have taken the right decision, and I will try to live up to their expectations. Samastipur has given me a big victory, and I believe that the people have given me a place in their heart. I had said that I have come here to seek blessings as a daughter and today they have accepted me as their daughter,” said Shambhavi Choudhary, according to PTI.
TMC candidate from Krishnanagar, ​West Bengal​, Lok Sabha seat Mahua Moitra says, “I am happy with my victory but considering the communal politics going on in India and Modi ji had said that he is contesting all 543 seats, I am happy that these elections have been held against him. The performance in Bengal has also been good,” she said, according to an ANI report.

On being asked how will be US-India relations after Modi 3.0, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller says, “So I expect a continued close partnership between the United States and India. There is a great partnership both at the government level and at the people-to-people level, and I fully expect that to continue,” an ANI report said.

For the first time, ​​Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to depend on two past-masters of coalition politics ​​– TDP Chief N Chandrababu Naidu and JD(U) chief and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar – to form the government. 
The Prime Minister is believed to have spoken to Naidu and is expected to join his swearing-in as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. A meeting of the BJP-led NDA is believed to have been scheduled for Wednesday for which both Nitish Kumar and Naidu have been invited.

The ​gap between the NDA and the INDIA alliance is so small​, just about 60 seats, that they can make a difference to which formation forms the next government. The Congress party has said that it will discuss the possibilities on Wednesday with its partners. So, as of today, the matter of who forms the next government is still open and it’s up to the President as to who she invites to form it.
The ​State that scripted the BJP’s uninterrupted reign at the Centre for two terms brought the saffron party below the majority mark ​on Tuesday. A number of factors combined to thwart the BJP’s carefully-crafted strategy in Uttar Pradesh and the prime among them was the reverse social engineering attempted by saffron party’s main challenger – Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.
The ​TDP, which joined very late to the NDA alliance, emerged as a major player​, giving the alliance a much-needed booster shot. With the BJP falling short of the magic figure, the TDP’s support turns crucial for the alliance to form the Government at the Centre. From just three in the 2019 elections, the alliance increased its tally to 21, pushing the YSRCP to just 4 (which won 22 in 2019).
The ​Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) target of achieving a hat-trick of clean sweeps in Gujarat came undone Tuesday​, after it conceded the Banaskantha Lok Sabha seat to its rival Congress.
For the first time since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, the BJP has lost a Lok Sabha seat in Gujarat, winning 25 of the 26 seats in the State. The saffron party had won all the 26 seats during the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections and had targeted to win all the 26 seats with a victory margin of 5 lakh votes.
The ​BJP’s backed splits in Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar’s NCP​, including the controversial seizure of their party names and election symbols, backfired spectacularly. Voter anger against turncoats, coupled with issues such as agrarian distress, inflation, and the lacklustre performance of sitting BJP alliance MPs, proved to be decisive factors in the BJP’s downfall in Maharashtra.
​In a major setback to the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal​, the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress is set to increase its seats in the state to 29 in the fiercely-contested LoK Sabha elections.
Despite the prediction of most of the exit polls that the BJP would get more seats than the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state, the saffron party has bagged a lesser number of seats in the 2024 LS elections than 2019 elections. 
With the BJP falling behind the majority mark and its poll pitch of ‘400 ke par’, opposition ​INDIA bloc said on Tuesday that the 2024 Lok Sabha election mandate is against Prime Minister Narendra Modi ​and he should own up the political and moral responsibility and step aside from another stint in power.
Unlike the previous two general elections, ​a clear mandate has eluded the BJP this time and the party appears set to win 240 seats​, down 63 from the 303 it had won in 2019, and 33 short of a clear majority of 272 in the 543-member Lok Sabha.
The BJP will make up for the shortfall with Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), which looked set to win 12 seats in Bihar, and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), looking to bag 17 seats in Andhra Pradesh besides minor allies including the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, the Lok Janshakti Party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha, and the Jana Sena Party. Together, the NDA constituents come up to about 291 seats, 19 over the majority mark in the Lower House.

NEW DELHI, June 4: Regional satraps are back to holding all the aces in this Lok Sabha elections as counting trends emerged on Tuesday, with Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP and Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party making stupendous gains in Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh respectively.
While the TDP and Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) hold the key to the government formation of the NDA after the BJP fell short of getting a majority on its own, some other regional parties like the YSRCP, BRS, BJD and BSP have lost ground at the hustings.
The 2024 Lok Sabha election result trends have shown the strengthening of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, emerging as a strong force by being ahead in 34 seats while the BJP was leading in 36 seats.
In 2019, the SP had won only five seats while the Bahujan Samaj Party, which is facing a rout this time, had bagged 10 seats.
Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress has also strengthened its position from 22 Lok Sabha last time and was ahead in 29 seats out of 42 in West Bengal this time.
K Chandrashekar Rao’s BRS was not leading in any seats in the counting so far in Telangana, even though it had won nine seats last time.
Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray) in Maharashtra was also leading in nine seats, against 18 last time before the split in the party. The NCP (Sharad Pawar) was also ahead in seven seats this time against five seats in 2019.
M K Stalin-led DMK held on to its dominance in Tamil Nadu and was ahead on 21 seats this time against 23 seats in 2019.
The TDP was ahead in 16 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh and in 135 assembly seats after it decimated the ruling YSRCP led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. YSRCP had won 23 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 and came to power in the state in 2019.
In Bihar, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) was ahead on all the five seats it contested this time.
The RJD of Lalu Prasad Yadav was also gaining four seats after it did not open its account the last time.
The JMM, whose leader Hemant Soren was arrested on corruption charges, was also ahead on three seats this time. The JMM got only one seat in the 2019 election. (PTI)

The counting today made for a nail-biting experience, with surprises and shocks all through. 
But one aspect that clearly comes out is the fact that by and large people have chosen good candidates over parties, which is quite a positive sign. 
The results have been a mixed bag, wherein some set targets have not been met, while in some cases parties have performed beyond expectations. 
In a nutshell, the people have given an intelligent and well thought-out verdict, and not one based on emotions and favouritism. 
Vijay Shekhar 
Chennai 

There are three welcome developments that have come out of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. One, we now have have a very strong Opposition that has been eluding us for a decade. 
Two, we may have a BJP government that has the chance to benefit from a coalition arrangement. 
Three, as a nation the electorate has attained a maturity that is getting scarcer in even established democracies elsewhere. 
People have authoritatively pushed to the front issues that are at the very core of their concerns. 
This will help the government in a course correction and a retuning of its policies. 
R Narayanan 
Navi Mumbai 

The election results, which were to usher in Modi 3.0, were unexpected. The exaggerated and high pitch campaigns of the political parties have crashed and shocked both NDA and I.N.D.I.A alliances. UP shocked. Even opinion and exit polls lost credibility this time. The governance will undergo a change with focus on the economy, development agenda, industry and job creation. Several minor alliance partners have dissipated. There are several surprises in the defeat of stalwarts. Two assembly election wins of NDA in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh will majorly transform NDA politics.PM Modi faces tough challenges in his third term. Subsequent elections should abandon caste and religious agenda. 
Vinod Johri 
New Delhi 

The results points to clarity in voters’ mind. The winners need not feel elated and the losers need not feel deflated as the margins of victory and defeat were so slender. 
Another message this election result gives is that people in general are not happy with the pro-rich policy that has been pursued in the last 10 years. There is a dire need to care for the middle class who cannot tighten their belts any further. Democracy survives better only in the presence of a strong opposition and absolute power given to any one party leads to authoritarian rule. 
Irrespective of the party that forms the government it is all the more important to keep in mind that enriching the rich, sharpening the communal divide and misusing the government agencies should be done away with. Focusing on employment, taming inflation and bridging the gap between the haves and the haves-not are to be prioritised, to avoid social conflict.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'The Atlantic'}",Vaibhav Vats,Many Indians Don’t Trust Their Elections Anymore,Modi rose from a level playing field that no longer exists.,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/05/india-election-democracy-modi/678336/?utm_source=feed,,2024-05-10T11:00:00Z,"Modi rose from a level playing field that no longer exists.
On March 21, a little less than a month before India’s national elections, the main opposition party, Congress, held a press conference to announce that its campaign was paralyzed. The government had earlier frozen the party’s bank accounts in connection with an alleged tax violation from the 1990s. Now the party was struggling to support its parliamentary candidates, and its ground organization had sputtered to a halt.
Later that evening, fewer than 10 miles away, cops and paramilitaries surrounded the official bungalow of Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi province and a member of another opposition party, seeking his arrest on corruption charges. His supporters began a spontaneous protest, and amid the frenzy, Kejriwal became the first sitting chief minister to be arrested in India’s history.
The events of March 21 are part of a pattern that has cast doubt on the legitimacy of India’s election. According to this year’s report by Freedom House, a bipartisan think tank that evaluates democracies across the world, Modi’s government “has selectively pursued anti-corruption investigations against opposition politicians while overlooking allegations against political allies.” Many of those politicians have then been cleared of the charges if they joined Modi’s party: Of 25 opposition leaders probed for corruption, 23 saw their charges dropped when they switched parties. These and other worrying developments are striking in a country that has long prided itself as the biggest and most unlikely modern democratic success story.
Ashoka Mody: Is India an autocracy?
India conducted its first election during the winter of 1951–2, a mammoth exercise that took five months to complete. For a nation that was overwhelmingly illiterate, poor, and racked by social divisions, the decision to adopt the universal adult franchise at one stroke was extraordinarily ambitious. Just preparing the country’s first electoral roll, enlisting 173 million voters, was a staggering undertaking—one actually completed before the constitution was even enacted in 1950. “Indians became voters before they were citizens,” the scholar Ornit Shani has written.
Indian elections have taken place, largely uninterrupted, ever since. Not only is this record rare among postcolonial nations; it is somewhat of a paradox within the context of India itself. Low indices for human development and shoddy public services testify to the country’s inefficiency on many counts, and yet, India has tended to organize the world’s largest elections with relative ease.
The country’s election commission is largely responsible for this success. The constitutional body has overseen 17 national elections and hundreds of provincial elections in states as large as European nations; today it caters to nearly 1 billion voters and marshals nearly 15 million workers to conduct a national election. The commission is led by a three-person panel whose chief, like a high-ranking judge, can be removed only if Parliament impeaches them. At least since the 1990s, chief election commissioners have been independent and powerful figures who inspire fear in politicians and their parties.
Narendra Modi has managed to undermine all that during his decade as prime minister. In December, his government passed a law amending the selection process for choosing election commissioners such that the executive branch would have the most say over the process. That he chose to interfere is little wonder. Independent election commissioners had posed an obstacle to Modi almost from the beginning of his political career.
When Modi was chief minister of the western state of Gujarat in 2002, a spasm of religious violence killed more than 1,000 people there, mostly Muslims. Modi dissolved the provincial assembly and called for elections six months ahead of schedule, likely hoping to capitalize on the climate of religious polarization that gripped the province. But J. M. Lyngdoh, then the chief election commissioner, visited Gujarat and concluded that local insecurity called for deferring elections until the winter. Modi responded by impugning Lyngdoh’s motivations and mocking his Christian identity.
By 2019, Modi had mostly taken care of this problem: He was ensconced as prime minister, and had rendered the election commission all but toothless, having filled the body with handpicked former bureaucrats closely allied with the Hindu right.
For decades, a stringent code of conduct governed elections in India, and transgressions could result in public censure, bans from campaigning, and, in extreme cases, the disqualification of candidates. And yet, in 2019, the commission heard five complaints against Modi for violating the election code—by seeking votes in the name of the military, for example, and appealing to the electorate on religious grounds. It somehow contrived to clear Modi in all five cases.
Five years later, Modi is leading an even more incendiary and divisive campaign, and the commission appears to be comatose. On April 6, Modi described the Congress party’s manifesto as reflecting the mentality of the Muslim League, the separatist organization that led to the creation of Pakistan and is widely reviled in India, even though the manifesto made no reference to religion. Then, in an election rally on April 21, Modi told voters that the Congress party intended to seize their private wealth and distribute it among India’s 200 million Muslims, whom he characterized as infiltrators producing more than their share of children.
Modi’s speech almost certainly violated not only the election code but also Indian laws against hate speech and inciting religious discord. Perhaps even Modi realized he had gone too far: The transcripts of the speech uploaded to the prime minister’s website did not include the most offensive passages. Even so, his remarks caused an uproar in India. Political parties and more than 20,000 private citizens complained to the election commission, seeking its intervention. If the electoral body did not act, Sagarika Ghose, an opposition legislator wrote on X, “then let’s please wind up the Election Commission and forget about the Model Code of Conduct.”
The commission responded timidly, with a notice not to Modi but to the president of his Bharatiya Janata Party. In the past, the commission directly censured political leaders for their violations; today its reluctance to confront the prime minister surprises no one. Commissioners know that standing up to Modi can exact a heavy price. In 2019, Ashok Lavasa, one of the three election commissioners, recorded a formal dissent from the decision to exonerate the prime minister on the five complaints. Lavasa’s phone was placed on a surveillance list, while his family endured months of harassment, including tax raids and investigations into his son’s business. In 2020, Lavasa resigned. He had been due to take over as chief election commissioner the following year.
I reached out to several former election commissioners for comment for this story. Two spoke with me off the record, kept deferring the date for a formal interview, and eventually stopped taking calls or responding to texts. One, Om Prakash Rawat, who was chief election commissioner in 2018, dismissed concerns about the commission’s independence as media fictions and suggested that Western democracies had perpetuated them in order to undermine India. Rawat told me that he did not think Modi and his party had violated the election code in 2019 or in the present election. Modi’s speech branding the Congress manifesto as reflecting the mentality of the Muslim League was merely politics as usual, he said.
As the election season has worn on and the commission has kept quiet, Modi has doubled down on his rhetoric, describing the Muslim electorate as “jihadi votes,” and the BJP has put out animated videos portraying Muslims as crafty and predatory animals.
Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi chief minister, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate, a federal agency that investigates financial crimes. Since Modi came to power in 2014, the number of investigations the directorate has conducted against political leaders has more than quadrupled, to 121. Of the leaders under investigation, 115 of them—95 percent—belonged to opposition parties.
Kejriwal is the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, an upstart populist outfit that has quickly risen to take charge of two northern provinces. A rousing orator, Kejriwal was known for his sarcastic and often humorous speeches critical of Modi. In the short term, arresting him served the BJP by eliminating a charismatic opposition politician from the campaign trail. In the long term, it dealt a blow to a rival who could one day become a national challenger.
Kejriwal was technically the first chief minister to be arrested in India’s history, but effectively, he was the second. In January, Hemant Soren, the chief minister of the eastern state of Jharkhand, had resigned a few hours before he was arrested by the directorate. Like Kejriwal, Soren had a commanding presence in a region where the BJP was markedly weak.
Few institutions have survived the democratic subversion of the Modi years. Soren and Kejriwal approached the courts, but an enfeebled judiciary is still vacillating on whether to grant them bail. Much of the mainstream news media purvey Hindu-nationalist propaganda, depicting Modi as the personification of the nation and his opponents as corrupt actors intent on destabilizing India. A recent analysis of six prominent networks from February through April, the months leading up to the election, found that 52 percent of their prime-time coverage attacked opposition parties; another 27 percent praised Modi and his government.
Under Modi, India has slipped 43 places down the World Press Freedom Index; it now ranks a dismal 159 out of 180 nations. Since 2021, Freedom House has categorized India as only “partly free” in its annual reports. That same year, the V-Dem Institute, an independent research organization based in Sweden, also reclassified India, observing that “the world’s largest democracy has turned into an electoral autocracy.”
These days in India, talk often swirls back to the Emergency, India’s previous era of authoritarian rule, in the 1970s under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The 1977 elections that ended the Emergency produced a staggering upset, with Gandhi losing her own parliamentary seat. But the Princeton professor Gyan Prakash, who wrote a book about the Emergency, told me that the analogy to the present moment was misleading. Gandhi freed opposition leaders from prison as elections approached; Modi has been doing the opposite.
“The 1977 elections were held fair and square,” Prakash told me. “One fears that is not going to be the case with 2024.”
In India’s stratified and deeply hierarchical society, elections have long been a great equalizer. During the campaign season, social boundaries between castes and classes seem momentarily to dissolve as passionate political debates break out in tea stalls and on crowded buses and subways. Candidates and parties produce festive road shows on city streets.
But Modi and his Hindu-nationalist juggernaut have quelled these energies. The current election feels sluggish. Most cities and towns have been bathed in the saffron hue of the BJP, and posters of Modi’s visage can be seen everywhere. Participation is correspondingly low; when voting began for more than 100 parliamentary seats on April 19, turnout was down more than three percentage points from five years ago.
Trust in the election commission is declining among voters; even fewer have confidence in the electronic machines used for voting. Making matters worse, this year’s turnout figures from the first round of voting were publicized a full 10 days later than normal, and they were expressed as percentages instead of whole numbers. Indian citizens rely on turnout data to assess the fairness of the vote. Now voters are openly voicing fears of sabotage; despite repeated appeals, the commission has not yet released the full figures.
The weakening of public faith in Indian elections is not surprising or accidental. The Hindu-nationalist movement has always been disdainful of Indian constitutionalism and democracy, seeing its participation in these processes as tactical accommodations on the path to its eventual goal of a centralized, authoritarian government. Commenting on India’s first election back in 1952, Organiser, the preeminent journal of the Hindu right, suggested that the country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, “would live to confess the failure of universal adult franchise in India.” Prakash told me that the government’s more recent ploys to throttle the opposition were part of the “BJP’s single-minded and ruthless drive for a one-party state.”
On April 22, a BJP candidate was elected unopposed from the Surat constituency in Gujarat, two weeks before elections were scheduled in the city of 1.8 million voters. The Congress candidate for the parliamentary seat had been rejected on a technicality; when the party put forward an alternative candidate, he was rejected too. Under mysterious circumstances, the remaining eight non-BJP candidates simultaneously withdrew from the race, paving the way for the BJP to win without a vote.
Vaibhav Vats: Violence is the engine of Modi’s politics
On the evening of the Surat victory, Jitendra Chauhan, an independent candidate from Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat, alleged in a video posted online that associates of the city’s sitting MP were threatening him, and that he feared he might even be killed if he didn’t withdraw his nomination. (The Gandhinagar MP is Amit Shah, India’s home minister and widely considered the second-most-powerful person in the country. The BJP denies Chauhan’s claims.) Over the following days, 16 candidates, including Chauhan, withdrew; many said they had faced pressure from powerful BJP politicians and even the police. Around the same time, in Indore, a Congress candidate went to the polling office to withdraw his nomination; when he emerged, he had joined the BJP.
Such strong-arm maneuvers offer one among several possible means of securing a one-party future. In January, during a mayoral election in the northern city of Chandigarh, a polling officer belonging to the BJP was caught on camera spoiling opposition ballots. That case resulted in a rare intervention: The election was overturned by India’s supreme court.
Through his decade in power, Modi has plowed the level playing field from which he rose. In 2014, when Modi led his insurgent campaign against the Congress, the media were free to robustly criticize the government, democratic institutions such as the election commission and the courts asserted themselves, and dissent did not carry the threat of prison.

BJP all set to fall short of absolute majority **INDIA bloc makes big gains ** Exit polls predictions proved wrong
NEW DELHI, June 4: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on Tuesday poised to form the government for a third consecutive term notwithstanding crushing losses in three Hindi heartland states after a bitterly fought election that was projected as a referendum on his popularity.
The Bharatiya Janata Party, whose candidates had contested in the name of Modi, won or was ahead in 240 seats and will fall short of the 272 majority mark and need the support of allies in the party-led National Democratic Alliance(NDA) for government formation, a far cry from the 303 and 282 seats it had won in 2019 and 2014 respectively to have a majority on its own.
With support from BJP’s key allies N Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP and Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), which were leading or winning 16 and 12 seats in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar respectively, and other alliance partners, the NDA appeared to be on course to bag around 290 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha. The TDP also swept the assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh dislodging Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s YSRCP.
Preparing to take office for a record equalling historic third term, Prime Minister Modi pledged to work with all states, regardless of the party in power, to build a developed India.
India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had served three consecutive terms.
In his first speech after the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Modi laid out his vision for the third term saying it would be a tenure of big decisions and key emphasis would be on uprooting corruption.
It is the first time that 73-year-old Modi will be dependent on allies to be in the government since he came into politics.
“The fight against corruption is becoming tougher by the day. Corruption is being shamelessly glorified for political interest. In our third term, NDA will focus a lot on rooting out corruption of all kinds,” Modi said.
Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge termed the poll outcome as the “victory of the people and that of democracy.”
“We had been saying that this battle is between public and Modi…This mandate is against Modi. This is his political and moral defeat. It is a big defeat for a person who sought votes in his own name. He has suffered a moral setback,” Kharge told reporters at the AICC headquarters flanked by Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi after the good showing by the Congress.
The elections also highlighted the revival of the main opposition Congress party under Rahul Gandhi, and the unexpected role of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh – under Akhilesh Yadav — as a giant slayer.
The trends and results did not throw up a landslide victory the BJP-led NDA had hoped for and what was projected by the exit polls. More than 640 million votes are to be counted in the world’s largest democratic exercise.
The NDA was stirred into life mostly around elections in the last 10 years as the BJP’s big majority and shrinking opposition in the Lok Sabha made its allies mostly redundant but this time around, allies will matter more than ever.
The Congress, which is part of the opposition INDIA alliance, was leading or winning 99 seats compared to 52 it won in 2019 eating into BJP’s share in Rajasthan and Haryana. The INDIA bloc won or was ahead in over 200 seats.
As SP chief Akhilesh Yadav kept the INDIA bloc morale high in Uttar Pradesh, the Trinamool Congress, another key ally of the opposition alliance, was leading or winning in 29 seats in West Bengal, higher than its 22 in 2019. The BJP, which had 18 seats in the last Lok Sabha election, was ahead in 12 seats.
In UP, the BJP won or was ahead in 33 seats as against its tally of 62 in 2019 and the SP’s numbers went up, largely attributed to three factors – consolidation of Muslim votes in favour of SP, smart seat sharing agreements with Congress to avoid splitting of non-BJP votes and widespread discontent with the BJP government over jobs and price rise. The SP was winning or leading in 37 of the 80 seats at stake.
Modi retained the Varanasi seat but with a reduced victory margin of nearly 1.53 lakh votes in Varanasi. In 2019, the margin was 4,79,505.
Rahul Gandhi, often lampooned by the BJP as ‘Shehzada’, won Wayanad(Kerala) and Rae Bareli(UP) seats by a huge margin of 3,64,422 votes and 3,90,030 votes respectively.
The campaigning for the elections, which were conducted from April 19 to June 1 in seven phases, was marked by divisive communal issues and excessive reliance on Modi for getting votes. The prime minister held more than 300 rallies, travelling tirelessly almost every day to multiple locations.
The results also blew away the BJP narrative that it will score big in the southern states this time. It, however, returned a tally of zero in Tamil Nadu, and lost seats in Karnataka.
The BJP did make inroads in Kerala, winning a seat for the first time in a state where the Congress and the Left are the major political force, and in Telangana where it won or was leading in 8 seats. Popular Malayalam actor Suresh Gopi won the Thrissur seat in Kerala to help the lotus bloom.
In Andhra Pradesh, BJP ally Telugu Desam Party won or was leading in 16 seats  and the BJP was ahead or winning in three.
The biggest setback for the BJP, which faced a stronger challenge from the opposition, however, was in the north where, besides UP, the BJP also faced losses  in Rajasthan and Haryana.
West Bengal also dealt the party a raw deal, although it more than made up for the losses in Odisha.
Madhya Pradesh went fully saffron with the BJP winning or leading in all 29 seats. In Gujarat, too, BJP was winning or leading in 25 of 26 seats.
The situation was not as decisive in other states.
In Bihar, the BJP was ahead in 12 and its partner JD-U in 13, a vote of confidence for its leader Nitish Kumar who swung from INDIA back to the NDA ahead of the elections. The RJD was poised to win four seats.
In Rajasthan, BJP was ahead only in 14 seats, against all 25 its alliance won last time. The Congress was ahead in eight.
Haryana also threw up a shock result for the BJP, where the party was leading only in five and the Congress in five. In 2019, the saffron party had bagged all 10.
It appeared that the election marked a return to regular politics, where voters were more concerned about bread and butter issues, especially in some Hindi heartland states where the opposition INDIA alliance managed to rally supporters around the issues of unemployment and price rise.
Maharashtra, with 48 Lok Sabha seats, saw the Shiv Sena split down the middle since the last election. The BJP, which won 23 seats five years ago, was down with leads in 11 seats, while its ally Shiv Sena could get seven.
On the other end of the spectrum, the Congress was ahead in 12 seats, up from one, and the Shiv Sena (UBT) in 19. The NCP Sharad Pawar faction could get seven seats, giving the INDIA alliance, forged together by the common dislike of the BJP, a possible 38 seats.
However, a silver lining was provided by Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Piyush Goyal who appeared on course to easy victories in Nagpur and Mumbai North respectively.
In Odisha, the BJP was doing spectacularly well, with leads in 19 out of 21 seats, while the ruling Biju Janata Dal was down to just one. It was also ahead in the Odisha assembly elections, leading in 76 out of 146 seats, a success show in the state it had never succeeded in capturing.
In Andhra Pradesh, the Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP was ahead in 16 seats of 25, the BJP in three and the YSRCP in four.
Trends for Karnataka showed potential gains for the Congress, with leads in nine seats, up from one last time. The BJP, which got 25 seats in 2019, was ahead in 17.
Tamil Nadu seemed to be scripting another story, not ceding any space to the saffron party. The ruling DMK was ahead in 22 and ally Congress in nine, a notch higher than their 2019 positions.(PTI)

NEW DELHI, June 4: Armed with the social justice plank and a slew of promises for welfare measures, the Congress made stunning gains with a spirited performance in the Lok Sabha polls that would not only silence its critics but also put the party on road to reclaiming its lost glory.
Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, former party chief Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra spearheaded an impressive campaign, underlining the welfare guarantees the party was offering to the people, but it was the push on social justice that seems to have made the difference with the weaker sections of the society seeming to have sided with the INDIA bloc in several BJP strongholds.
The opposition INDIA bloc led by the Congress appeared set to be a formidable force in the Parliament this time, though still possibly in opposition benches.
The Congress leaders attributed the party’s stunning comeback to its narrative focusing on issues of the people and its ‘Nyay’ guarantees.
Also, the top Congress leadership strongly raised the Congress’ claim at rallies that the BJP would change the Constitution which seems to have had a strong impact on the ground.
Another crucial aspect was the INDIA bloc fighting with unity at the hustings which brought it rich returns in states such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
Addressing a press conference here, Rahul Gandhi said that all Congress leaders respected the INDIA bloc allies and wherever the alliance fought “we fought as one”.
He also said the general election was a fight to save the Constitution.
“It was on my mind that the people of this country would rally together to save the Constitution. The first and biggest step towards saving the Constitution has been taken,” Gandhi said, adding that it was the poor and the marginalised who stood up to save the Constitution.
He added that the Congress and the INDIA bloc had given India a new pro-poor vision.
“The main thing this election has said, the country has said, is that we don’t want Narendra Modi, Amit Shah to be running this country,” Gandhi said.
After the campaign for the Lok Sabha polls ended, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had said the party set the narrative during the Lok Sabha polls with a sharp campaign that was devoid of “agar-magar, kintu parantu” and pushed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the “back foot”.
Ramesh said the first shot at creating a new narrative for the Congress was fired by Rahul Gandhi in the ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’. The yatra was held between September 2022 and January 2023.
The 144 days, 4,000-km walk from Kanyakumari to Kashmir was a very transformative movement for the Congress and for Indian politics, he said.
“He (Gandhi) constantly saying that ‘main nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan kholne aaya hu’ was the theme. What gave structure to the 2024 campaign was the ‘Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’ (this year) in which Gandhi had unveiled the ‘paanch nyay pachchees guarantee’,” Ramesh said.
He said the Congress’ ‘guarantee cards’, which state the party’s promises under the ‘Yuva Nyay, Kisaan Nyay, Nari Nyay, Shramik Nyay and the Hissedaari Nyay’ themes, made a major impact.
Political commentator and former Congress leader Sanjay Jha cited the BJP’s loss in the Lok Sabha seat of Ayodhya and said the people of Uttar Pradesh and India have rejected the politicization of religion.
“There is hope. Always. Never give up on the inherent goodness of humanity,” he said.
Though, the Congress pulled off a stunning upset, the question that lingers in the mind is — what if they had started early and not allowed to take the BJP a headstart in the campaign?
Political observers are of the opinion that it delayed seat-sharing among the INDIA bloc allies till the assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram in the hope that a good showing would hand it better bargaining power for seat-sharing.
However, the alliance did manage to get its act together as the elections were declared and ran an aggressive joint campaign, the results of which were seen in states such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
Going forward, the Congress, which was battling an exodus of leaders, will have to ensure that it builds on the gains as it is still in power on its own only in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Telangana.
The party would also need to look at a generational shift in leadership roles and Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi may need to step up in organizational responsibilities.
Many had begun writing the obituary of the Congress but its leaders insist that it is not a mere political party but it is an ideology, an idea, which cannot be finished off. (PTI)

 The mammoth exercise to count votes polled for the Lok Sabha seats in the 2024 elections will begin at 8 am on Tuesday.Trends and results will begin from 8 am today.
Results of the Assembly elections in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh were held simultaneously with voting for the 543-member Lok Sabha. Results of 175 Assembly constituencies in Andhra Pradesh and 147 Assembly constituencies in Odisha and results of bypolls in 25 Assembly constituencies will also be declared today.
Strict security has been put in place for the smooth conduct of counting of votes for over 8,000 candidates in this general elections.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will seek a third consecutive term in government, while the Congress-led opposition aims to unseat them.
Most exit polls have predicted a return of PM Modi to power, a development which will make him the first Prime Minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to secure a third successive term in power,
Meanwhile, a delegation of Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc leaders met with the Election Commission of India urging it to ensure that postal ballots are counted and their results declared before the outcome of the EVMs is announced.
Earlier, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar had said that a ""very robust system"" has been put in place. ""There are around 10.5 lakh booths. Each booth will have 14 tables. There are observers and micro-observers. Nearly, 70-80 lakh people are involved in the process,"" he said.
The national capital is all set to witness the battle. With tight security arrangements in place, Delhi is well-prepared to watch the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
Around 70 companies of the security forces will be deployed at all seven counting centres across the national capital as part of the elaborate security arrangements made by the Delhi Police for today.
Delhi traffic police issued a fresh advisory ahead of the counting of votes scheduled for Tuesday, listing key roads where traffic restrictions and diversions will start from 5 am onwards to ensure smooth vehicular movement.
Prime Minister Modi's hometown, Gujarat, is also preparing for the vote-counting day as security forces rehearse and perform drills for the effortless conduct of D-day. Exit polls have predicted the return of the BJP to power. Various exit polls have given the BJP more than 64 seats in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is poised for a hat-trick win in Lok Sabha polls with a massive majority. Exit polls were predicted on Saturday and indicated that the ruling party at the Centre would improve its performance in several states ruled by other parties.
A few exit polls predicted that the BJP-led NDA could reach the goal of ""400 paar"" stated by BJP leaders in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls. The exit polls predicted that the ruling BJP-led NDA is poised to improve its performance over its 2019 record when it won 352 seats.
Two polls predicted the BJP would also improve its numbers from the 303 seats it won in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
In the 2019 elections, NDA wrested 353 seats, of which the BJP won 303 alone. The Opposition's UPA got only 93 seats of which the Congress got 52.The Lok Sabha elections were conducted in seven phases- on April 19, April 26, May 7, May 13, May 20, May 25 and June 1.The counting trends and results, as per data entered by RO/ARO for AC/PC will be available on the ECI website as well as on the Voter Helpline App, both iOS and Android Mobile Apps, according to the ECI.
The Voter Helpline App can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or Apple Play Store. Users can use the available filter to find out the winning/leading or trailing candidate details, along with the constituency-wise or State-wise results from the Voter Helpline App.
The local display of the trends and results by the CEOs/ROs/DEOs may also be done through the Digital Display Panels, it said.

The Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam seeks to reserve one-third of the total number of seats for women in Lok Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies and Delhi Assembly.
The party also promised to establish women help desks at police stations, for the safety of them. ""We have established Shakti Desks (Women Help Desks) in police stations. We will further ensure their expansion for timely investigation and resolution of issues.""
""We will strengthen the Emergency Response Support System and enhance the capabilities of Emergency Helpline 112,"" said the BJP in its manifesto.

Indias Supreme Court says the arrest of NewsClick websites founder and editor Prabir Purkayastha last year under a stringent antiterrorism law was illegal and has ordered his release on bail.
Purkayastha was arrested in October, nearly two months after a New York Times report alleged his English-language news website had been financially supported by a network pushing Chinese propaganda.
The 75-year-old journalist was charged with receiving foreign money and criminal conspiracy, and arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), a stringent antiterrorism law which makes it virtually impossible to get bail.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that Purkayasthas arrest by the Enforcement Directorate, Indias financial crimes agency, was illegal since it failed to communicate the grounds for detention in writing to him.
Justices BR Gavai and Sandeep Mehta declared his arrest invalid in the eyes of law and said he should be released, subject to the furnishing of bail bonds. The top court said its ruling on Purkayasthas confinement was not a statement on the merits of the ongoing case against him.
A good day for independent media! said NewsClick in a post on X, welcoming Purkayasthas release.

 NewsClick (@newsclickin) May 15, 2024

NewsClick, with an independent and critical focus on Indias progressive movements, was founded in 2009 by Purkayastha, who was previously arrested in 1975 during a state of emergency imposed by the then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
Last year, The New York Times reported that NewsClick was financed by the United States-based millionaire Neville Roy Singham. The report said the website sprinkled its coverage with Chinese government talking points  claims Singham and NewsClick rejected.
The report also accused Singham of working closely with China  the common enemy of India and the US  and of financing its propaganda worldwide.
At the time, NewsClick said it does not publish news or information at the behest of any Chinese entity or authority, and does not take directions from Singham on its content.
Relations between New Delhi and Beijing have been tense due to a long-running border dispute that escalated into a deadly clash between their troops in the Himalayas in 2020 and sent diplomacy between the two nations into deep freeze.
 

 
In 2021, ED officials first raided the NewsClick office and Purkayasthas residence over allegations of money laundering and foreign funding. During the time of the raid, the news website had extensively reported on the massive antigovernment protests by Indian farmers.
But no arrests were made during that raid, with the authorities saying their investigation against the media outlet will continue.
In October last year, the ED again raided the NewsClick office and the residences of nearly 80 journalists and other individuals associated with the New Delhi-based organisation. Computers and mobile phones of its employees and independent writers who wrote for it were seized.
Prime Minister Narendra Modis government said the raids were justified as foreign funding of the media groups must be assessed by the investigating agencies. If anyone has committed anything wrong, search agencies are free to carry out investigations, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur had told reporters after the raids.
But media watchdogs and rights groups said the raids were part of a government assault on press freedoms since Modi came to power in 2014. He is seeking a third term in the ongoing multiphase national election.
Last year, Indian tax authorities also raided the BBC offices in New Delhi and Mumbai, shortly after the British broadcaster released a documentary that was critical of Modi. Dozens of Indian journalists critical of the Hindu nationalist government have complained of increased harassment, including on social media  where the governing BJP party has a powerful presence.
India fell to 159th rank in the 2024 World Press Freedom Index, an annual ranking by non-profit Reporters Without Borders, a marginal improvement from 161 last year.

From Modi fan to Indian PMs most formidable critic,"When the 29-year-old YouTuber attacks Modi, he gets a bigger audience than any opposition leader.

Whats his secret?
New Delhi, India  An ominous soundtrack serves as his backdrop as YouTuber Dhruv Rathee appears on the screen. His trademark collarless shirt  red on this occasion  and knowing half-smile are his only introduction before he launches straight into a troubling question: Is India becoming a dictatorship?
On the surface, the 29-year-old says, India appears to be a democracy: Citizens can choose from among a range of parties and decide whom to vote for. But the reality, he suggests, is more complex. He dives into allegations of corruption, misuse of supposedly independent institutions and subversion of democratic processes levelled by critics against Prime Minister Narendra Modis government.
Its an intense 29-minute video, packed with Rathees monologue, slick animations and infographics, as he accuses the Modi government of systematically attacking the media and opposition. Issues like the year-long ethnic violence in the northeastern state of Manipur, where more than 200 people have been killed, have disappeared from the public discourse, Rathee says.
Like the music and animated caricatures he uses to drive home his arguments, the picture of India that Rathee paints is grim. It is a portrait far removed from the success story that Modi and his team insist they have turned the country into: A nation with growing global clout on the cusp of a $5 trillion economy.
As Indias giant national election, with 970 million eligible voters, winds towards its conclusion, with the final phase of voting scheduled for June 1, and results on June 4, nowhere has that clash of narratives played out more sharply than on social media. On WhatsApp, for instance, Modis Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) reportedly runs 5 million channels: 400 million Indians are on the platform.
But if WhatsApp is big in India, YouTube is even bigger: With 460 million users, the country is the video platforms biggest market. In one corner are a slew of YouTube channels, many with millions of viewers, that purport to be bringing viewers news but that often peddle disinformation and Islamophobia. In the other are Modi critics like Rathee, who too are accused by their opponents of selectively parsing data and facts to criticise the prime minister, while whitewashing embarrassing details about opposition leaders and parties.
At a time when studies show that more Indians trust news they get on YouTube and WhatsApp than what they source from mainstream news channels, Rathee has emerged as a formidable digital force. Polls suggest that Modis popularity remains high. But they also reveal that inflation and joblessness, issues of the kind that Rathee hammers on about in his shows, worry Indians the most.
And the YouTubers messaging reaches far more Indians on the platform than any opposition party or leaders campaign slogans. Consider the numbers: On YouTube, Rathee has more than 20 million subscribers, nearly four times the BJP channels count. The Congress, the principal opposition party, has a little more than 5 million YouTube subscribers, while its biggest leader, Rahul Gandhi, has 6 million.
Rathees count, by comparison, is close to the man he often tries to take down in his videos: Modi, who has 23 million YouTube subscribers. In some cities, opposition parties have taken to screening Rathees videos in public, on mobile vans.
We will bring a Tsunami that will destroy the whole IT Cell, Rathee wrote on X last month, referring to the social media arm of the BJP that its critics accuse of driving political disinformation.
It was all very different a decade ago. Back then, to Rathee, Modi symbolised hope.
When Narendra Modi first came into power, Rathee had just finished high school and moved to Germany to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering.
This is when he also started his YouTube channel. Rathees first video was a travel vlog shot on his iPhone 5s, which he says he edited for more than two months. It was the logical extension of his childhood passion for videography  in 2003, he says, he created a claymation video using a simple webcam.
In 2011, he, like millions of Indias youth, found themselves politically drawn to the first major nationwide movement the generation had seen  huge anticorruption protests against the then government of the Congress party that roiled the nation and paved the way for Modis national rise.
Like millions, Rathee also saw hope in Modis passionate advocacy against corruption in politics and black money in 2014. Rathee was a Modi supporter who welcomed his ascent to power.
But soon, the doubts started creeping in, and reached breaking point in 2015. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), nationally in the opposition but in power in Delhi, had introduced an anticorruption helpline. The Modi government at the centre battled with the AAP state government for control over the helpline, leaving Rathee disillusioned.
That was a very shocking moment for me. I realised that he was not interested in removing corruption from India, says Rathee, speaking of Modi, in an interview from an undisclosed location.
Rathee says his frustrations were compounded when he saw many mainstream TV channels demonstrate a deep bias in favour of Modi and the BJP.
It was against that backdrop that Rathee uploaded his first political commentary on YouTube, on September 16, 2016. The video, shot entirely on his phone, focused on the BJPs IT cell and the alleged use of information  and misinformation  in shaping political narratives, through edited photographs, manipulated videos, fake quotes and paid posts to make a theme trend on social platforms. Rathee worked alone at the time and compared with what he puts out now, it was relatively crude in its production quality.
He has not looked back since then. Over the past eight years, he has published nearly 650 videos on his main YouTube channel  he still also maintains a separate channel with travel videos  many of them viewed by tens of millions of viewers. Some of the videos unpack history, such as what unfolded during World War II, or the heatwave searing through large parts of India. But for the most part, his focus is on politics.
I like doing my educational videos and travel vlogs more but this is not the time to remain unaffected, he tells Al Jazeera.
Driving the success of his videos is a cocktail of ingredients, say Rathee and other YouTube influencers and political satirists who have tracked his work.
The heartland of the BJPs support base is north India, where the party swept several states in 2014 and 2019, and has dominated many others. Hindi is the primary language in the region, with large rural belts. Rathee, who is himself from the agrarian state of Haryana, speaks simple, everyday Hindi in his videos.
That Rathee was a former Modi supporter himself gives him a cachet with others who have backed the prime minister at different times, but might now be wavering. And Rathee carefully uses the same nationalistic language that the BJP employs  a powerful communication strategy, says Akash Banerjee, a political satirist on YouTube, who also runs a channel called Deshbhakt (patriot in Hindi) that is often critical of the Modi government.
He speaks to people in a language that appeals to them [Modi supporters and fence sitters] and also reaffirms the fact that the message is not antinational  its anti-hate and anti-party worship, Banerjee says. The idea is to educate people that worshipping your country or religion is not equivalent to worshipping political leaders or parties.
Rathee also accepts that his videos have evolved with time  and that he has learned in the process. Today, his videos have a self-assurance and confidence that he says have come through trial and error over many years. And though he is no journalist, he tries, he says, to bring journalistic rigour to his videos  which he insists are rooted in facts.
I take criticism from well-meaning people seriously, he says. In some of my earlier videos, I mixed facts with opinions but that has changed now.
Until 2020, he was doing everything  from research and scripting, to shooting and editing  on his own. The disadvantage was that I also made a lot of mistakes in my videos, he says.
Today, Rathee works with a team of researchers, scriptwriters and video editors. We have made different systems to ensure factual accuracy. The overall production quality has also improved incredibly.
Over the years, Rathee also developed a signature presentation style, shooting all his videos wearing a solid-coloured crewneck T-shirt. The videos all start with Rathee greeting his viewers with the words, Namaskar doston (Welcome friends).
Banerjee says Rathees ability to explain complex topics in simple words while keeping the facts intact and the production value high is what helps him grow his audience.
In terms of reach, its quite unprecedented, Banerjee says of Rathees success. It signifies that there is definitely a disquiet. There are people who are willing to listen to facts. Its a signal that the propaganda of the IT cells on social media is definitely failing.
But Rathee himself believes the secret to his success lies, at least in part, in something simpler: His personal, emotional, almost boy-next-door approach in videos, which makes him more relatable to audiences and marks him out as different from more traditional, political hacks.
That approach is complemented by the other YouTube channel that Rathee runs: Dhruv Rathee Vlogs. It has 2.7 million subscribers, a fraction of the audience that comes to his political channel. But it offers insights into Rathees other obsession  travel.
The channel maps trips that Rathee and his German wife Juli take around the world, documenting their adventures: Meeting baby turtles at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia in one video, visiting a remote tribe in Mongolia in another; relaxing at a beach in the Seychelles and having a meal at one of the worlds highest hotels in Oman; visiting a London film set where a Harry Potter film was shot and diving into the worlds deepest pool in Dubai.
As with his political videos, Rathee speaks to his viewers in Hindi. Unlike his political channel though, Rathees approach here is light, relaxed, and meant to take his audience on a holiday, vicariously.
Sometimes, that lighter, less intense touch creeps into his political content. Like when the BJP released an election advertisement in which an actor depicting an Indian student stuck in Ukraine amid Russian shelling gratefully tells her father that Modi rescued her and her friends by stopping the war.
Rathee sarcastically responded by mimicking the actor. His war rukwa di paw paw (Modi ji stopped the war, Papa) turned the advertisement into a meme that went viral, turning the Modi governments claim  which the countrys Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself has disputed  into a subject of ridicule.
For the most part, though, Rathee deals with darker themes. In 2023, after Modi promoted a controversial film, The Kerala Story, that claimed a conspiracy to convert non-Muslim women to Islam to send them to West Asia as fighters for the ISIL (ISIS) armed group, Rathee released a 23-minute video debunking the movies assertions. Following criticism, the filmmakers accepted that the movie was not entirely fact-based and that they had exaggerated the scale at which women from the southern state of Kerala had travelled to the Middle East to join ISIL (ISIS).
Rathee has his critics. In late May, Swati Maliwal, a member of parliament from the AAP, who has fallen out with the leadership of her party that governs in Delhi, alleged that Rathee had amplified a campaign against her that had resulted in her receiving death threats. Rathee has rejected those allegations.
Others have accused him of parroting opposition talking points selectively. And earlier in May, the Modi governments minister for earth sciences and food processing, Kiren Rijiju, referenced an early video from Rathee that criticised corruption during the Congress governments rule from 2004 to 2014.
Rathee hit back with a video, telling Rijiju that his earlier comments proved that he was no mouthpiece of any party, before then pointing out instances when the cabinet minister had apparently flip-flopped on his own comments.
Their sparring  a federal minister vs a YouTuber  continued on the social media platform X. Youre a bright young man. Use your energy for nations growth, Rijiju posted.
No need to run down others to become more popular. Nothing wrong in being the spokesman of Congress & AAP but do spread positive vibes to create a better image of India.

 Kiren Rijiju (???? ?? ??????) (@KirenRijiju) May 23, 2024

Speaking to Al Jazeera at his bungalow in New Delhi, Rijiju insists that the accusations at the heart of many of Rathees videos that the Modi government is dictatorial in its approach towards critics and the media  are bogus.
There is so much freedom. These people abuse the prime minister all day, Rijiju says. The people can see through this and thats why they [critics, including influencers like Rathee] will remain in an echo chamber.
Yet, for many aspiring YouTube influencers especially those eager to challenge the Modi governments narrative  Rathee is a source of inspiration.
Rathee says he knows that the reach of his videos, though considerable, is still small compared with the BJPs well-oiled narrative-shaping machinery. So in addition to his own videos, he tries to amplify the voices of others.
You can only do so much individually. I will make as many videos as I can. There are other creators whore doing good work. I am trying to collaborate with other creators and share them on my platforms, he says.
The smaller content creators that he supports see a significant spike in their views. Political satirist Arpit Sharma has a day job as a chartered accountant and used to make anti-Modi sketches for fun. But he did not have professional editing and production resources.
What he did have was an influential follower on X: Rathee. He [Rathee] reached out to me and got my video edited by his team and shared it on his own platform, says Sharma.
That Sharma video has been watched by more than 14 million people. Rathee promoted another of Sharmas videos again earlier this week, criticising the Modi government for failing on its promise to ensure the safety of women in India, highlighting several high-profile rape and sexual abuse cases.
Sharma says Rathees bootstrapped approach to building his own platform has been an inspiration to creators like him.
But taking on the Indian government publicly at a time when Indian politics is deeply divided comes with risks. Several influencers and online platforms with content critical of the governing BJP have been banned or censored in recent years.
In April, the Modi government asked YouTube to take down National Dastak, a YouTube channel run by a journalist-turned-politician. As farmers protested against the Modi government in states near Delhi earlier this year, the administration ordered X to block nearly 200 handles. The website of hate crime tracker HindutvaWatch was also blocked in India ahead of the elections. And India routinely ranks among the countries that send X the most requests to block accounts.
Seema Chishti, editor of the digital publication The Wire, says that the governments use of IT laws to target critics sends a message of censorship.
You kill the rooster to scare the monkeys. There is self-censorship and a chilling effect it brings with it, she says. Media advocacy groups have also warned about a new law that the Modi government has said it wants to bring, that they say could give the administration more control over broadcasters. The attempt is to create a China-type firewall. I have been around as a reporter for around 33 years, but I havent really seen this sort of censorship, says Chishti.
Rathee says he has been targeted by disinformation campaigns linking him and his wife Juli to Pakistan, Indias arch-enemy. He regularly receives death threats while his wife has received rape threats online.
He insists he is not scared, but the YouTuber is careful not to disclose either his location or that of his family still in India.
At the end of the day, Rathee says, he has no option but to carry on doing what he does. He says he knows his channel could get banned in India. But the price of staying silent is bigger, he insists.
The time to speak up is now, otherwise it would be too late, Rathee warns in a video interview with Deshbhakts Banerjee.
We are not a dictatorship yet but we are on the path to becoming one.

New Delhi, India  As the worlds largest  and one of its most unequal  democracies votes in a mammoth national election, a new debate has gripped the campaigns of both Prime Minister Narendra Modis ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress party.
At the heart of this latest political slugfest is the idea of a potential redistribution of wealth. But while the Congress party has alluded to the need for some resources to be reallocated to traditional marginalised economic and caste-based communities, Modi and the BJP have accused the opposition of plotting to hand over wealth from Hindu households to Muslims.
So whats the controversy about and what do economists say about the proposals for a relook at Indias wealth distribution?
In April, Rahul Gandhi, a scion of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, said if voted to office, his Congress party would conduct a caste census along with an economic and institutional survey to determine who owns what and earns how much. Following this, a portion of the 16 trillion rupees ($192bn) of benefits given to 22 big businessmen by the Modi government would be transferred to 90 percent of the countrys people, as a starting point for delivering social justice, he said.
Gandhi described the caste census as an X-ray into Indian society. This is not a political issue for me, this is my life mission, Gandhi said. You can write down; no force can stop the caste census.
The Congress party manifesto doesnt talk directly about redistribution of wealth. It says, We will address the growing inequality of wealth and income through suitable changes in policies. On the caste-based census, it says, Congress will conduct a nation-wide Socio-Economic and Caste Census to enumerate the castes and sub-castes and their socio-economic conditions. Based on the data, we will strengthen the agenda for affirmative action.
Yet, responding to Gandhis speech, Modi has been repeating in election rallies that the Congress party has hatched a deep conspiracy to snatch the wealth of people and gold of Hindu women to distribute it among Muslims, whom he described as infiltrators and those who have more children.
The opposition has accused Modi of resorting to lies and hate speech to distract people from high unemployment and rising prices, and has complained to the election commission.
India is the fastest-growing major economy in the world, but also suffers from deepening inequality. Numerous studies have shown that the benefits of Indias brisk growth have been unevenly distributed.
A new study by researchers at the World Inequality Lab shows that income and wealth inequality in India today is, in many ways, worse than it was even under British colonial rule. Indias richest 1 percent control 22.6 percent of national income and more than 40 percent of the countrys wealth. Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent control less than 10 percent of national wealth.
Inequality was worsened over the past decade of Modis rule. India has 271 dollar billionaires, third behind only China and the US  and worlds highest number of poor at 228.9 million, according to Oxfam India.
The Congress party has accused the Modi government of crony capitalism and favouring certain businesses in government contracts. The government has denied the accusations saying it has not favoured companies and has instead invested in welfare programmes to improve the lives of the poor.
Experts say Indias inequality is the result of the prevailing economic and political system. Even as both governments of the BJP and the Congress have launched reforms and pushed for economic growth over the past three decades, they have failed to generate enough employment, check inflation, and move the workforce from low-income farming to well-paying non-farm jobs, resulting in high inequality of wealth and income.
There is no one view among economists. Those against the idea say redistribution will be counterproductive by taking capital from wealth generators thereby handicapping and disincentivising them to contribute to the economy.
But others argue that redistribution is required not only in wealth but also in opportunities like education, healthcare, access to financial resources, water and energy, which will boost poor peoples capacity to generate income and reduce inequality in the long run.
Redistribution of income and wealth is a very good idea in contemporary India, said Deepankar Basu, economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
The high and rising level of economic inequality suggests that the economic system does not work equally for all. The wealth and income being generated by the system is predominantly being cornered by the rich, said Basu. Not only does this have economic implications, but it also distorts the democratic process  extreme wealth inequality allows the super-wealthy to disproportionately influence the political process through various channels like campaign contributions and donations to political parties. This erodes the democratic system of governance.
Devashish Mitra, professor of economics, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University, New York, agreed that some wealth distribution might not be a bad idea.
But it is a politically contentious issue, and there might be political problems in enacting any kind of means to redistribute wealth, Mitra acknowledged.
One solution, Mitra said, might be to combine wealth redistribution with some reduction in income taxes. That would partially compensate for the wealth redistribution. Then, we will have a combination of wealth taxes and income taxes that could lead to both greater equity and greater efficiency than in the current situation, he said.
The Congress is arguing that data from a caste-based census will help with the implementation of welfare and social security schemes. The party has promised to raise a Supreme Court-mandated cap on reservations in higher education and government jobs for underprivileged groups called Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs).
If successful, this political pitch could in theory help the Congress break the BJPs growing stranglehold over the Hindu vote across castes and sub-communities. Modi, in turn, has responded by alleging that the Congress wants to give Muslims benefits that are meant to be allocated on caste  not religious  lines. He has cited a 2006 speech by then Congress Prime Minister Manmohan Singh where he said disadvantaged communities and religious minorities, including Muslims, should have the first claim on national resources.
The Congress has insisted that it has no wealth redistribution plan, and that Singhs 2006 comments had been misinterpreted.
In an April 24 television interview, Sam Pitroda, an adviser to the Nehru-Gandhi family and head of the overseas wing of the Congress party, added another twist to the debate by arguing that India should debate whether an inheritance tax might help reduce wealth inequality.
Modi has responded by accusing the Congress of plotting a wealth and inheritance tax that would snatch away peoples wealth accumulated through hard work. The Congress, he said, aims to loot people zindagi ke saath bhi aur zindagi ke baad bhi (in life, and after death), echoing the popular tagline of the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation.

 BJP (@BJP4India) April 24, 2024

The Congress party distanced itself from Pitroda comments by saying his view does not reflect the position of the party. Jairam Ramesh, a spokesman of the Congress party, referred to past comments by BJP ministers in favour of an inheritance tax. Modi has clarified that the BJP has no intention to bring such a tax.
An inheritance tax, also known as estate tax or death duty in some countries, is a levy imposed on the total value of money and property of a deceased person before it is passed on to their heirs. Generally, this tax is determined by assessing the value of the assets remaining after certain exemptions or deductions. Essentially, the government collects a share of the wealth transferred from the deceased to their beneficiaries.
Globally, inheritance taxes are widespread in nations including the UK, Japan, France, and Finland. The United States does not impose an inheritance tax at the federal level, though it has an estate tax. However, six states independently retain inheritance tax regimes.
There is no estate duty or inheritance tax payable in India. Estate duty on property that is passed on to the legal heirs on the death of a person was removed in 1985 by the then Congress government of Rajiv Gandhi  Rahuls father  citing the need to simplify the tax system and promote investment and saving. However, other taxes such as capital gains tax, wealth tax, and gift tax are applied to inheritances depending on the circumstances.
Before the removal, estate duty was payable on a slab basis ranging approximately from 7.5 percent to 40 percent of the principal value of the estate. This estate tax was introduced in 1953 in a bid to reduce economic inequality.
In recent years, worldwide, there has been a trend towards scrapping estate or inheritance tax. Five European countries have abolished their estate or inheritance taxes since 2000. On the other hand, US President Joe Biden has been supporting higher taxes on inherited wealth.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said inheritance tax could nullify Indias decade of progress. Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India has said that while inclusive growth will aid in the expansion of the economy, taxing the rich more is not the way to do that.
Other economists back an inheritance tax. An inheritance tax will make the whole economic system fairer by redistributing some of the accumulated wealth away from the children of wealthy people, said Basu. These tax revenues can then be used to finance public education, provide public healthcare and affordable housing, and support mitigation efforts related to the negative effects of climate change, which disproportionately impacts the poor.
Syracuse Universitys Mitra said that while an inheritance tax might make some economic sense, he sees enormous scope for corruption, stemming from the subjectivity in the valuation of inheritances and the unlimited scope in misreporting the actual value of inheritances.
Progressive taxation and greater social spending could be other solutions to boost economic equality. A greater emphasis on wealth taxes such as capital income taxation, net wealth taxation, and transfer taxation would generate tax revenue that could allow greater investment in health, education and infrastructure.
There are many policies that can be adopted to address rising economic inequality in India, said Basu. These include increasing the tax rate for the top 1 percent of income earners, increasing the corporate tax rate on relatively large firms, improving educational opportunities and making them accessible for the poor.

Mumbai, India  Ever since he can remember, Rohit Kumar Sahu knew he wanted to go to college and get a well-paying, white-collar job. His father delivered courier packages across the eastern Indian city of Ranchi on a bicycle, and Sahu had no idea how to realise his dream.
He signed up for a job with the food delivery app Zomato, thinking this could be his path to earning money to pay for college fees.
Sahu began with just a few hours of work so he could attend college alongside his job, but he couldt make enough deliveries on his bicycle  and that meant he couldnt earn much.
He took a loan from friends and a finance company and bought a scooter so he could take on more work. Even as the loan repayments kicked in, Zomato reduced its payment to delivery workers like Sahu, and he got fewer deliveries as more drivers joined the app.
Sahu scaled up his work to as much as 14 hours a day, going to college only to take exams, but he still had to borrow money from his parents for loan repayments.
Frustrated, Sahu and other drivers in Ranchi staged a strike asking to be paid better. But, Sahu says, company officials told them they could hire others from Indias growing army of bike riders instead and could block the strikers from the app.
This broke the strike  and left Sahu with loans and his dream of college and a steady job seeming more distant than before.
Sahu is among a growing number of Indians bearing the brunt of the increasing informalisation of work in India. The India Employment Report 2024, a study released in March by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Institute for Human Development, says that Indias workforce is getting more informalised and that the quality of employment has suffered especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sahus experience is characteristic not only of Indias growing gig economy, but also seems symptomatic of the broader employment landscape. About 70 percent of Indias construction workers and 62 percent of its casual agricultural workers earn salaries below minimum wage, found the study, which uses government data.
Even in the formal sector, about 18 percent of workers did not have work contracts that could protect them. They also had fewer benefits than before, the study found.
While Indias economy is pegged to grow at a robust 6.5 percent in the financial year ending March 2025, according to the United Nations Trade and Development, its ability to create quality jobs to meet the aspirations of its increasingly educated youth has emerged as one of the key issues of the national election currently under way.
Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote in a recent column, With tens of millions of highly educated young people joining the workforce every year, unmet expectations and growing social unrest threaten to turn the countrys much-anticipated demographic dividend into a disaster.
Not surprisingly, opposition leaders such as Rahul Gandhi have accused the government of destroying employment. INDIA bloc, the coalition of opposition parties that Gandhis Congress Party is a part of, has announced that it will create a right to apprenticeship that could lead to a job for young people if the coalition is elected.

While recent reports have pegged employment differently, the quality of jobs seems more tenuous than before.
There has been a slippage in the quality of jobs, said Amit Basole, head of the Centre for Sustainable Employment at the Azim Premji University in Bengaluru.
Ravi Srivastava, one of the lead authors of the India Employment Report and director of the New Delhi-based Institute for Human Developments Centre for Employment Studies, said The share of informal workers in the economy went up.
Nearly 90 percent of the workforce is informally employed, the report says. Self-employment as a form of work grew 3.8 percentage points between 2019 and 2022, while regular employment declined to 21.5 percent from 23.8 percent. The share of casual employment declined to 22.7 percent in 2022 from 24.2 percent in 2019.
Basole noted, We see a shift since the 2000s, with a destruction of jobs at the lower end.
This trend seems to have accentuated sharply after 2019, when the pandemic hit, and millions were pushed into more insecure employment as the country went into a sudden lockdown overnight and businesses big and small shut, with many of the latter never recovering from that shock.
With workers back in their villages, agriculture saw an increase in workers of nearly 56 million from 2020 to 2022, reversing a slow trend of workers moving from agriculture into more value-added service sector jobs, the report said.
Women also increasingly entered the workforce during this period, but a little more than half of them did unpaid work in agriculture, usually on family farms, Srivastava said, adding that it is a trend that has continued.
The data shows the precarity of womens work. The degree of informality for women workers is higher than for men, he said.
Work for both men and women may have remained precarious even after the pandemic as men often returned to big cities for jobs in construction or in the gig economy, both areas with little security.
The Indian government has objected to the ILO report and its employment estimates, adding that the growing gig sector was not well accounted for in the report.
Indias government think-tank, NITI Aayog, estimated that 7.7 million people worked in such jobs in 2020-2021. It expects more than 23.5 million workers could be employed in gig work by 2029-2030.
Srivastava says that while it is hard to estimate the number of gig workers, the total has only gone up since the pandemic.
In cities, too  as not all shops, restaurants and salons had reopened  women were forced to take up gig work.
In May 2022, Mumbai beautician Gurpreet Sharmas two fingers got stuck together while fixing nail extensions for a client. Unsticking them with oil had led to swelling and burns on her fingers, limiting her ability to work or do household chores for months. Urban Company, a platform offering at-home servicesthrough which she got the job, did not provide her medical insurance since it covered only hospitalisation.
Months later, with her husbands work as an assistant dance choreographer in Bollywood getting more irregular, Sharma once again restarted work with Urban Company. A clients dogs bit her while she was at a home pedicure appointment. She had pressed the apps emergency button, but to no avail. The client paid for Sharmas anti-rabies shots after she filed a police complaint. Another time, a friend accepted on the Urban Company app a job of doing a facial for a man. But she fled that clients house unpaid because of sexual advances he made.
Like Sahu, Sharma and her Urban Company colleagues have spent the last two years trying to form a union. They asked to be called employees rather than partners and get benefits accordingly, but to no avail.
Pratik Mishra, of the All India Gig Workers Union, which had helped Sahu in organising efforts, said he had worked with unions in Ranchis large coal and steel sector for years, but what he encountered with delivery workers was like nothing he had seen before.
They were so replaceable, the company did not even consider them to be workers and they could get blocked by an algorithm anytime. They were so vulnerable.
After his fiasco with unionising, Sahu looked for other means to fund his studies and joined a loan collection agency where his job was to make calls to chase outstanding dues along with occasional food deliveries.
Now 22, he has also enrolled for a masters degree in computer applications, along with preparing for several of Indias competitive exams for coveted, and stable, federal government jobs.
He can hardly afford to attend college due to work commitments, and he studies through free tutorials on YouTube.
He is downbeat about his job prospects. More than 400,000 applicants take the exams for less than 12,000 government jobs. Kya chance hai? he asks rhetorically. What are my chances?
Then he answers himself: 0.001 percent.
Tapping into this aspiration for government jobs, Tejashwi Yadav, the opposition leader from Sahus neighbouring state of Bihar, has announced that the opposition INDIA bloc will provide 10 million jobs, partly by filling open government positions.
For now, Sahu worries he is not developing the skills he needs through the practical training that the college provides, but the need to earn money has limited his choices. Hum to saari taraf se phas rahe hain [We are trapped all around], he said, referring to his job prospects.
Alexandra Hermann, lead economist in London at Oxford Economics, said a major impediment [to creating quality jobs] has been human capital levels.
Just as Sahu worries about the skills hes acquiring, surveys have shown that learning levels have been low in Indian schools and colleges although enrolment is up.
Government spending on infrastructure development has led to the creation of construction jobs rather than the service sector jobs that Indias increasingly educated youth such as Sahu aspire to, Hermann pointed out, adding, that those are not necessarily the kind of jobs we want. It is time for the government to spend on improving educational levels and creating service sector jobs, she said.
The Indian employment report also found that when students do get a higher education, it leads to better employment.
Lal Singh, a 24-year-old from Mumbai, earned enough money from food delivery jobs to pay for courses that enabled him to become an app developer, the job he dreamed of.
Growing up, Singhs father had sold magazines at Mumbais busy traffic signals, and the family lived in a packed slum in the citys southern tip. But Singh had grown up playing video games and idolising Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.
While in college, he had joined a skills training course by the non-profit Antarang and found a job with a software company. While there, he continued doing courses to upgrade his skills. He now develops apps for United States companies, but is finding it hard to move to a better role in the currently tight job market.
But Singhs success is not easy to replicate. While more Indians are getting a college education than before  and the enrollment for women in science degrees is among the highest in the world, according to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman  more than 83 percent of Indias unemployed are among the youth, the ILO report says.
Sahus exam for a government job is in July, but juggling between loan collection work, deliveries, college and test preparation means he constantly feels he is failing somewhere, and the prospect of landing a good job is only getting more difficult. When things get hard, Singh occasionally turns back to food delivery.

"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Al Jazeera Staff,Four anti-Muslim claims dominating Indias election: Whats the truth?,India's Hindu nationalists have peddled conspiracy theories about Muslims. Here are some facts about their claims.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/25/four-anti-muslim-claims-dominating-indias-election-cycle-whats-the-truth,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24110227039963-1715684544.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,2024-05-25T09:25:17Z,"Indias Hindu nationalists have peddled conspiracy theories about Muslims. Here are some facts about their claims.
In April, as India was preparing for the first phase of its mammoth seven-stage national election that will conclude with results on June 4, pollsters asked voters what issues they were most concerned about.
Jobs and inflation ranked the highest in their responses. But as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have tried to defend their decade-long record of governance in the face of criticism from the opposition led by the Congress party, they have also been accused by critics of promoting tropes that, for a long time, have been anti-Muslim dog whistles for the countrys far-right.
The opposition has accused Modi of hate speech against Muslims, and Indias election commission  the independent authority tasked with holding the countrys polls  has sent a warning to the BJP party chief about the PMs comments. Election laws do not allow the overt use of religion to garner votes. But Modi has denied that he engaged in hate speech.
Al Jazeera fact-checked four claims about Muslims  Indias largest religious minority, with a population of 200 million people  that have dominated the election discourse in recent days.
What Modi said:During an election rally on April 21 in the western state of Rajasthan, Modi claimed that if the Congress party came to power, it would distribute the countrys wealth among Muslims. When they were last in power, the Congress said that Muslims have the first right to the nations resources. What does that mean? If they come to power, that means they will collect all the wealth. And who will they give it to? Those who have more children. To infiltrators.
Nearly a month later, when asked by a Network 18 reporter why he had used that language while speaking about Muslims on the stage in Rajasthan, the Indian prime minister denied he was referring to Muslims. Why are you doing injustice to Muslims? he said, saying that overpopulation prevails in poor families. I never said Hindu or Muslim.
But Modi has previously used the trope of Muslims having a particularly high reproductive rate. In 2002, after deadly anti-Muslim riots in the state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister at the time, he faced questions over his governments failure to support relief camps for victims,which were mostly set up by non-profits and Muslim groups. In a campaign rally at the time, Modi had suggested that such relief camps could become baby-producing centres, and how for some people, that could mean a family of as many as25 children.
The larger claim: The idea of a Muslim population explosion is central to a Hindu majoritarian conspiracy theory that suggests that the Muslim community is deliberately growing fast to overtake the Hindu population in the future.
It is not dissimilar to the great replacement theory in the West, a white nationalist conspiracy theory that says the immigration of people of colour will make white people a minority in Western countries. In India, the far-right refers to it as population jihad.
After the prime ministers Economic Advisory Committee released a report on May 7, suggesting that the share of Hindus in Indias population had declined by 7.8 percent between 1950 and 2015, and the Muslim share had grown by 43.2 percent, BJP leaders amplified suggestions that Hindus in the country would be in danger if the opposition came to power.
Share of Hindus shrunk 7.8% between 1950 and 2015. Muslim population grew at 43%.
This is what decades of Congress rule did to us. Left to them, there would be no country for Hindus. pic.twitter.com/xNUramJyNE
 Amit Malviya (???? ?? ??????) (@amitmalviya) May 9, 2024


The facts: Critics have argued that the BJPs claims make selective use of numbers to buttress a narrative of a demographic explosion, otherwise belied by the governments own data. Overall, Muslims do have a higher birth rate than Hindus, but the gap between them is shrinking. The National Family Health Survey in India shows that Muslim women in India are facing the sharpest drop in total fertility rates in the three decades from 1992 to 2015. The total fertility rate for Muslims has dropped by 2.05 percent, compared with a 1.36 percent decline among Hindu women.
Fertility rates in India also vary widely by region. Nationally, the fertility rate is 2.36 percent for Muslims and 1.94 for Hindus. But in the north Indian state of Bihar, for instance, where 83 percent of the population is Hindu, the overall fertility rate is 3 percent  higher than the national average for both communities. Meanwhile, in the southern state of Kerala, where Hindus constitute 55 percent of the population and Muslims 27 percent, the overall fertility rate is 1.8.
What Modi said:In an April 23 speech, Modi also warned people that the Congress would take away the possessions  such as the bridal necklace, or mangalsutra  of Hindus and give it to its vote bank. Modi was widely understood to have been referring to Muslims. He has often accused the Congress of a politics of appeasement towards Muslims, which in the April 23 speech, he said he had exposed.
In the April 21 speech two days earlier, he referred to comments in 2006 by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the Congress party to suggest if the opposition came to power, it would give Muslims the first rights to the nations resources.
The larger claim:Modi and the BJP have long alleged that the Congress favours Muslims over Hindus and that, through its decades of rule, the Congress  the party of Mahatma Gandhi that led the countrys freedom struggle  had appeased Muslims. In essence, the argument is that Muslims in India have been given privileged access to wealth and public benefits.
The facts: From education to health to income levels, Muslims are the most economically disadvantaged religious group in India. The governments latest data suggests that while Muslims constitute 14 percent of the national population, they represent only 4.6 percent of students enrolled in higher education.
In June 2023, an Indian English daily, The Hindustan Times, analysed the governments All India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS) and Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) to show that Muslims are the poorest religious group in India.
Some analysts believe that Modis claim about former PM Singh assuring Muslims of the first right to national resources was a misrepresentation of what he had said. Singh, in his 2006speech, had referred to prioritising the governments responsibility to traditionally underprivileged castes, socially and economically backward communities, and religious minorities, particularly Muslims. Then, in a separate sentence, Singh had said:They must have the first claim on resources.
When we listen to the entire speech of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, we understand that he was not only talking about Muslims. He was talking about all deprived sections, Siddarth Sarathe, a fact-checker from the Quint, an Indian media outlet, told Al Jazeera.
 

 
What Modi said: During a rally in West Bengal state on May 12, Modi said the opposition Congress party was planning to take away job reservations from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes (OBCs)  underprivileged communities that are beneficiaries of Indian affirmative action policies  and give them to Muslims.
On May 21, he doubled down on the claim in another speech.
The larger claim:Modi and the BJP are accusing opposition parties of taking away affirmative action benefits meant for lower-caste Hindus and handing those over to Muslims.
The facts:The Indian governments affirmative action programmes  reservations in jobs and education  are solely based on caste and socioeconomic criteria, not on religion. A Pew Research Center report from 2021 says that nearly all Indians, regardless of religion, identify with a caste. About 43 percent of Muslim respondents identified as part of the Other/Most Backward classes.
In state after state, governments across party lines have for decadesoffered caste-based reservations. And those belonging to traditionally underprivileged castes have been beneficiaries  whether Hindu, Muslim or from any other faith.
In fact, Modi himself boasted in 2022 of his track record in Gujarat, when he led the state.
Among Muslims in Gujarat, there are 70 groups, who are OBC. When I was in Gujarat, they used to get benefits in the OBC category, he said.
What BJP says:Modi referred to thisconspiracy theory in passing in a speech in April, but it is a favourite theme for the BJP and its allies. In the southern state of Karnataka, which voted in late April and early May, and where the BJP was voted out of power last year, BJP leaders have claimed that cases of love jihad have gone up since then.
The larger claim:But what is love jihad? The conspiracy theory that accuses Muslim men of deliberately luring Hindu women into converting to Islam. The theory has existed since the late 2000s, and prominent cases emerged in 2009 in Kerala and Karnataka.
The theory has been amplified by the BJP governments across the country, with several states introducinganti-conversion legislationand intensifying police crackdown on Muslim men and interfaith couples.
A Bollywood film titled Kerala Story released last year was also accused of peddling the love jihad theory. The film, which was promoted by Modi, showed women and girls in southern Kerala state converting to Islam to be recruited into the ISIL (ISIS) armed group. It also claimed that 32,000 had disappeared from the state to join ISIL.
The facts: The love jihad theory is not backed by facts or evidence, and Indian courts have ruled out that there was an organised conspiracy by Muslims to woo Hindu women and convert them to Islam. Bridge, a Georgetown University research project, has called it widely debunked in a factsheet.
The claims in Kerala Story were also challenged by both fact-checking groups and by local communities in Kerala. The filmmakers admitted that the figures used in the film were inauthentic and that only three women joined ISIL.

Rahul Gandhi, a prominent figure in the Congress Party, the key opposition force challenging the BJP, has promised to abolish the Agnipath scheme introduced in 2022. The policy is seen as a complete overhaul of Indias recruitment to non-officer posts in the army, and is aimed at recruiting soldiers on a contract basis for a four-year term, without a pension.
The Congress has vehemently opposed the scheme, claiming it reduces the participants chances of gaining permanent jobs with the military, which guarantee fixed salaries and pensions, including in case of death on duty. Speaking at an election rally in the state of Jharkhand, Gandhi also promised to overhaul the BJPs existing Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, which in 2017 replaced a variety of indirect domestic taxes. Congress previously claimed that GST had wrecked the economy, and vowed in its election manifesto to introduce a new GST-2.0 with a single tax slab, supposedly less of a burden on the poor. Sonia Gandhi, Rahuls mother and currently the chairperson of the Congress Party, on Tuesday, released a video in which she claimed that BJP policies were responsible for youth unemployment, crimes against women, and discrimination against dalits (lower caste Hindus), adivasis (tribals), and minorities. The BJP, Gandhi claimed, craved power by rejecting inclusivity and dialogue.
My dear brothers and sisters,Youth unemployment, crimes against women, and discrimination against Dalits, Adivasis, and minorities have reached unprecedented levels. These challenges stem from the niyat and niti of PM Modi and the BJP which aim for power rejecting pic.twitter.com/4npHwd8DNW
The Congress manifesto also claimed that the people of India are divided into economic terms due to the BJPs policies. Instead, it pledged to build a fair, just, and equal-opportunity economy and bring prosperity to all sections of the people.The BJP, however, accused the rival party of intending to seize and redistribute the wealth of Indians, and giving preference to the largest minority, Muslims. Modi courted controversy last month when he claimed that Congress would give the countrys wealth to those who have children, indirectly indicating Muslims. The Congress denied the claims and accused the leader of hate speech. Following the remarks, the Election Commission of India (ECI), an independent poll body, sent a notice to the BJP.
In a separate development on Tuesday, the election body directed social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to take down an animated video post published by the BJP allegedly targeting Muslims. The response was based on a complaint from the opposition, which claimed the video stirred enmity and hatred.The ongoing election in India to elect 543 members of the Lower House (Lok Sabha) to form the next government has been dubbed the worlds largest democratic exercise, as over 960 million people are eligible to vote. It is conducted in seven phases  the first three were held on April 19 and 26 and May 7. The remaining phases will be held on May 13, 20, and 25, and June 1. Vote counting will take place on a single day, June 4.

          / AP
        
Millions of Indians are voting Saturday in the next-to-last round of a grueling national election with a combined opposition trying to rattle Prime Minister Narendra Modi's campaign for a third-consecutive term for himself and his Hindu nationalist party.
Many people lined polling stations before the start of voting at 7 a.m. to avoid the blazing sun later in the day at the peak of Indian summer. The temperature soared to 43 Celsius (109.4 Fahrenheit) in the afternoon in the Indian capital. 
Lakshmi Bansal, a housewife, said while the weather was hot, people usually went out to shop and even attended festivals in such heat. 
""This (election) is also like a festival, so I don't have a problem voting in the heat,"" Bansal said.
Saturday's voting in 58 constituencies, including seven in New Delhi, will complete polling for 89.5% of 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament. 
The voting for the remaining 57 seats on June 1 will wrap up a six-week election. The votes will be counted on June 4. 
President Droupadi Murmu and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar were among the early voters. Opposition Congress party leaders, Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi, also voted in New Delhi.
Mehbooba Mufti, a former top elected official of Indian-controlled Kashmir, held a protest with her supporters Saturday claiming that scores of her party workers were detained by the police to prevent them from voting. Mufti, the chief of the People's Democratic Party who is contesting the parliamentary election in the Anantnag-Rajouri district, said she complained to election officials.
In West Bengal state, workers belonging to the All India Trinamool Congress party, blocked the car of Agnimitra Paul, one of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party candidates, as she proceeded to vote in the Medinipur constituency. The two parties are rivals in the state and their workers often clash on the streets.
This election is considered one of the most consequential in India's history and will test Modi's political dominance. If Modi wins, he'll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term, after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.
A less-than-expected voter turnout in the previous five rounds of voting seems to have left both sides guessing about the elections' outcome. 
Election authorities said they are taking steps to ensure voters' comfort, such as setting up fans and tents and providing drinking water.
Most polls predict a win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
Modi was involved in a highly acrimonious and mudslinging campaign with the opposition, led by Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family that has produced three prime ministers.
""When the polls began it felt like a one-horse race, with Modi leading from the front. But now we are seeing some kind of shift,"" political analyst Rasheed Kidwai said. ""The opposition is doing better than expected and it appears that Modi's party is rattled. That's the reason you see Modi ramping up anti-Muslim rhetoric to polarize voters."" 
Kidwai said the opposition has challenged Modi by centering its campaign narrative on social justice and rising unemployment, making the contest closer than expected.
Modi ran his campaign like a presidential race, a referendum on his 10 years of rule. He claimed to help the poorest with charity, free health care, providing toilets in their homes, and helping women get free or cheap cooking gas cylinders.
But he changed tack after a poor turnout of voters in the first round of the election and began stirring Hindu nationalism by accusing the Congress party of pandering to minority Muslims for votes.
Hindus account for 80%, and Muslims nearly 14%, of India's over 1.4 billion people.
Manish Bhatia, a New Delhi voter, said that ""politics on the basis of caste and religion is dangerous for the country,"" adding that voting should be based on how candidates perform. 
Nearly 970 million voters  more than 10% of the world's population  were eligible to elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years.
Voters' relative apathy has surprised some political analysts. In the five rounds of polling, the voter turnout ranged between 62.2% to 69.16%  averaging 65.9%. By comparison, India's 2019 national election registered the highest-ever voter turnout  67.11%. Modi's BJP won 303 seats in parliament in 2019.
Modi's inauguration of a massive Hindu temple for the most revered Lord Rama, his massive roadshows, and big public rallies raised the BJP's hopes of a massive surge in voters' support. 
The current prime minister came to power in 2014, dislodging the Congress party that governed the country for nearly 55 years after India won independence from British colonialists in 1947.
Before the election, the opposition INDIA alliance was seen bickering, but it has since held together, particularly after two chief ministers of two opposition-controlled states were sent to jail on corruption charges. Both deny the accusations. 
One of them  New Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal  has since been released on bail and returned to the campaign trail.
In March, Gandhi completed a 6,713-kilometer (4,171-mile) walk across the country, starting in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur, to raise awareness on issues of poverty, unemployment, and democracy with voters. 
""The walk helped Gandhi boost his image as a serious politician among the voters, and that is helping the opposition,"" Kidwai, the political analyst, said.

He was expected to boast about achievements like generous welfare programmes and spaceflights. He was to reaffirm that the new Ram temple in Ayodhya represented a cultural assertion for India's majority Hindus. Even foreign policy was anticipated to influence the ballot, with the publicity boost afforded by Mr Modi's hosting of the G20 summit last September. Opinion polls have predicted a third, record-equalling landslide win for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
But early in the gruelling six-week election, Mr Modi's campaign shifted gears, using divisive rhetoric that has raised questions about his tactics. He's been accusing the opposition, led by the Congress party, of appeasing the Muslim minority community.
Muslims make up 14% of India's more than 1.4 billion people. Taking a cue from Mr Modi's campaign, social media posts by the BJP have, according to the opposition, ""demonised"" Muslims.
He told a rally on 21 April that the opposition Congress wanted to distribute wealth to ""infiltrators"" and to ""those who have many children"". His remarks were widely seen as referring to Muslims. 
At another rally, he warned women that the opposition would confiscate their gold and redistribute it to Muslims. He accused the Congress of orchestrating a ""vote jihad"", urging a ""certain community"" to unite against him. Mr Modi even said the Congress would select the Indian cricket team ""on the basis of religion"". 
That's not all. In a recent interview Mr Modi said the ""whole world"" was trying to influence the elections. This week, Mr Modi blamed the Congress for taking ""truckloads"" of money from billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has long spoken about the close ties that Mr Modi shares with the country's two richest men. 
""For the first time you have spoken in public about Adani and Ambani. Is it your personal experience that you know they give money in trucks?"" Mr Gandhi responded in a video message. Neither businessman has reacted to the comments.
India's opposition has also accused Mr Modi of Islamophobia, calling his remarks ""divisive, hate speech"". The Congress has demanded an investigation into a potential code of conduct violation. Since the BJP's rise to power, hate speech against India's 200 million Muslims has increased. But Mr Modi's fiery rhetoric on the stump has surprised many, as they expected a focus on highlighting his achievements instead. 
""To be honest, I thought Mr Modi's campaign would be much more about the rising India story, and about what they had done for the people,"" says Rahul Verma of the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), a Delhi-based think tank. 
Others say Mr Modi's remarks are not unprecedented. They point to many such instances during his previous election campaigns, including what they call his ""inflammatory rhetoric"" after the riots in Gujarat in 2002 ahead of the state's assembly elections. ""So, it has not surprised me, but is has shocked me. We often refer to such rhetoric as dog-whistling but there was nothing subtle about the language being employed,"" says Milan Vaishnav of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
For one, many say, the BJP might have been spooked by a significant dip in turnout in early rounds of voting amid what has been a rather low energy election. In the previous two elections, won decisively by the BJP, high turnouts benefitted the party - 2014 was largely a vote against the Congress, and 2019 was a vote for Mr Modi. 
Second, the opposition has been trying to reshape the narrative of the 2024 election, shifting focus from being solely a referendum on Mr Modi to campaigning on issues like unemployment, social justice and economic inequality.
Political scientist Neelanjan Sircar suggests that the BJP excels in national elections when it focuses on overarching national issues. He told a podcast recently that the party's not ""playing its strongest game"" when elections become more regionalised, and local factors come into play.
Mr Modi's party is targeting 370 seats this time, up from 303 in 2019. However, their rallying cry of ""Abki Baar, 400 par""  (This time, above 400), aiming for the party and its allies to secure a landslide, might have backfired. The opposition appears to have seized on the slogan, portraying the BJP as a dominating force set to reshape India with a massive majority.
""The opposition is using this slogan to say if they come with such huge majority, the BJP will change the constitution. And the opposition's narrative to empower poor and lower castes might have got some traction given there are high levels of economic anxiety evident in the pre-poll surveys,"" says Mr Verma. ""This might have provoked Mr Modi to take this narrative head on and give it a Hindu-Muslim twist.""
Is Mr Modi's divisive rhetoric a sign of desperation? 
Not really, says Mr Vaishnav. ""To me, it is designed to mobilise his cadres and perhaps to make up for an underwhelming performance in the first few phases.
""Desperation suggests that the BJP is losing, which I do not believe to be the case. Meeting the new target of 400 seats will be difficult unless the BJP can retain its seats from 2019 as well as expand into new areas.""
Despite Mr Modi's rhetoric on the stump, he has sung a different tune in recent interviews with news networks.
""I am not anti-Islam, nor am I anti-Muslim,"" he told Times Now.
He said his government's welfare benefits extended to all, irrespective of their community or religion, adding that ""social justice and secularism is a guarantee from Modi"". 
Mr Modi criticised the opposition for using Muslims as political pawns and suggested that the community should reflect on its own situation. ""Muslims should introspect why there's a sense of shortcomings within the community."" He said the Muslim community was changing all over the world. ""When I go to the Gulf countries, India and I get so much respect. Here there's opposition,"" he said.
Unravelling the complexity behind election victories in India is always a challenge. Gilles Verniers, a political scientist, believes they are rarely fought and won based on past accomplishments.
""Voters instead determine their choice according to what parties and candidates offer for the future. After building its past campaigns on welfare, security and nationalism, and having scored on these matters, the BJP does not have a lot of new ideas to offer to voters, hence the exacerbation of ethnic and religious nationalism,"" he says. 
Mr Modi and his party will disagree. But one thing is evident: this election has not yet manifested itself as a sweeping wave favouring any side, regardless of which party stands to gain or lose from it. ""In politics,"" says political analyst Pratap Bhanu Mehta, ""never underestimate the power of boredom"". That could account for what many say is the BJP's ""nervousness"".

The post featured a video of opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaking from a dais.
A part of the video appears to show him saying: ""Narendra Modi will remain the Prime Minister of India. Take it in writing, Narendra Modi can become the prime minister of India. We have done our best, you will see our alliance will get not a seat in Uttar Pradesh.""
The post surfaced in the middle of India's marathon six-week parliamentary election, the largest democratic exercise in the world.
Analysts expect an easy win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP thanks in large part to his aggressive championing of India's majority Hindu faith -- and a disparate opposition of more than two dozen parties.
Similar posts featuring the edited video were also sharedelsewhere on X and on Facebookhere and here.
Comments on the posts indicated social media users believed the claim.
""When this fool already knows that Modi will win the elections, why is he contesting,"" one commented.
""The people of the country have known that Rahul Gandhi is a foolish leader, and the destruction of the Congress Party is certain to be in his hands,"" said another.
But there were no official reports as of May 23, 2024 indicating Gandhi said the BJP will win the election.
In reality, the video was edited from a speech where he said the opposite.
A keyword search on YouTube found Gandhi's complete speechlivestreamed on the verified account of his Congress party on May 10, 2024 (archived link).
The video's description said it was filmed in Kanpur city in Uttar Pradesh state. It read:""Rahul Gandhi's roar in Kanpur, this speech will overturn the entire election! 'Modi is gone... Goodbye, Thank You.""
Below is a screenshot comparison of a frame from the edited clip (left) and the video uploaded on the Congress party's verified YouTube channel (right):

But what he actually said was:""Narendra Modi will not be the Prime Minister of India. Take it in writing, Narendra Modi cannot become the Prime Minister of India"" (archived link).
The word ""not"" was edited out in the circulating video.
Moreover, at the1:41 mark in the video, Gandhi's actual remarks were:""We have done our best. Now you see, our alliance will get not a seat less than 50 in Uttar Pradesh.""
This part was also altered to make it appear he said the opposition alliance ""will get not a seat"" in the state.

                        A Part Apart: The Life and Thought of B.R. Ambedkar                    

                        B.R. Ambedkar: The Man Who Gave Hope to Indias Dispossessed                    


                        The Evolution of Pragmatism in India: Ambedkar, Dewey, and the Rhetoric of Reconstruction 
On January 17, 2016, Rohith Vemula took his own life. A twenty-six-year-old Ph.D. student at the University of Hyderabad, he was a Dalit (the caste formerly called untouchables) and a member of the Ambedkar Students Association, which combats caste discrimination. The university had suspended his stipend following a complaint by the leader of the student wing of Indias ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that Rohith had physically assaulted him. The suspension made him despondent and unable to make ends meet, leading to his death. Rohith left a poignant suicide note in which he wrote of his dashed hopes of becoming a science writer like Carl Sagan. But he also called his birth a fatal accident, a reminder that the caste system had determined his status as a Dalit for life.
The word caste (jati in Hindi) is derived from casta, used by the Portuguese centuries ago to describe the divisions in Hindu society according to varna (literally translated as color but meaning quality or value). Ancient Sanskrit texts prescribed a four-varna social order: Brahmins (priests) at the top, followed by Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (merchants and artisans), and Sudras (agricultural classes) in descending order of ritual purity. Hindu society actually consists of thousands of castes, each with its place in this hierarchy. There is also a fifth group, which is viewed as so impure as to be outside the varna order. These are the untouchable castesDalits, as we call them now. They perform jobs, such as manual scavenging and the disposal of dead animals, considered so unclean that the very sight of them is deemed polluting.1
This ordering system is hereditary. Hindus are born into a caste and remain in it until death. Some castes belonging to the varna order have historically achieved mobility and moved to a higher varna by adopting Sanskritizing practices, like vegetarianism. But even this limited mobility is closed to untouchable castes, which remain stigmatized for generation after generation and find the doors of economic and social mobility shut tight.
Rohiths suicide note sparked debates across India. How was such social inequality still practiced in the worlds largest democracy seventy years after independence from British rule? Attention turned to B.R. Ambedkar, not just because Rohith belonged to an organization bearing his name but also because Ambedkar, who died in 1956, has been increasingly recognized for his writings about caste as an entrenched instrument of social, economic, and religious domination in India. As he famously said in 1948, Democracy in India is only a top-dressing on an Indian soil, which is essentially undemocratic.
Now popularly addressed with the honorific Babasaheb, Ambedkar has long been known as a political leader of Dalits. He popularized the use of Dalitmeaning broken or scattered, first used in the nineteenth century by an anticaste reformeras a term of dignity for untouchables. He is lauded as the chief draftsperson of the Indian constitution, which legally abolished untouchability. But few recognized him as a major thinker on the relationship between social and political democracy. This changed with the 1990s anticaste movement and the introduction of reserved slots for backward castesthe intermediate castes belonging to the Sudra varnain public service jobs and universities. Political activists and academics turned to Ambedkars work to explain everyday discrimination against the lower castes, such as their relegation to menial jobs, humiliation in workplaces and housing, denial of entry into temples, separate wells in villages, and segregation from upper- and intermediate-caste neighborhoods.2 His rediscovery as a political philosopher led to the publication in 2014 of a new edition of his book Annihilation of Caste (1936), with an introduction by Arundhati Roy. It dwelled on his clash with Mahatma Gandhi, who opposed his argument that caste was the social bedrock of Hinduism.
Caste remains a contentious subject, and scholars disagree on the institutions nature and history. British colonialists interpreted it as evidence of Indian societys basis in religion and its lack of a proper political sphere, which was filled by the colonial state. Marx adopted this view, writing that the subcontinent knew no real history until its conquest by Britain, only a succession of wars and emperors ruling over an unchanging and unresisting society. Colonial writing and practice drew on Brahminical texts to understand and rule India as a society organized by its predominant Hindu religion.
The French anthropologist Louis Dumonts Homo Hierarchicus (1966) gave this understanding the imprimatur of scholarship by arguing that Homo hierarchicus, rather than the Western Homo aequalis, undergirded Indian society. Following Dumont, anthropologists studied castes and their hierarchical ordering according to the Brahminical principles of purity and pollution. It was not until 2001 that Nicholas Dirks persuasively argued that the British were crucial in institutionalizing caste as the essence of Indian societythough they did not invent it, they shaped caste as we know it today.3 In place of a range of precolonial social orders based on a variety of factors, including political and economic power, society across India became defined by castes, with Brahmins at the top and Dalits at the bottom.4

As a system of inequality, caste has met with criticism and protests for centuries. Today activists demanding the dismantling of caste privileges in employment, education, housing, economic mobility, and social respect come up against the Hindu nationalist BJP government led by Narendra Modi, which advocates ignoring caste difference in the interest of Hindu unity. The BJP is the political arm of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a paramilitary Hindu cultural organization that since its founding in 1925 has campaigned for an organicist Hindu unity, expressing admiration for the national unity model advanced by fascism and Nazism.5 The RSS calls for reforming the most extreme aspects of caste, such as the practice of untouchability, but like most reformers, including Gandhi, does not challenge the four-varna order, regarding it as a divine organization of society in accordance with Hindu ideals. For the RSS, focusing on the differences in caste access to wealth and social status fractures the unity of Hindus; it instead calls upon castes to unite for a nation-state that guarantees Hindu supremacy. Accordingly the Modi government has systematically persecuted minority and Dalit activists as antinational elements. Hindu nationalist mobs have also assaulted and lynched Muslims, Christians, and Dalits.
Against this background of threats to democracy, Ambedkar acquires a new significance. The Indian politician Shashi Tharoors lucid biography is addressed to a general audience. But to appreciate the depth, complexity, nuances, and changes in the Dalit leaders thought and politics, one should read A Part Apart by the journalist Ashok Gopal. He has pored over Ambedkars writings and speeches in English and Marathi, and the result is a stunning, comprehensive, and thoughtful account of Ambedkar and his times. The title is drawn from a comment Ambedkar made in 1939: I am not a part of the whole, I am a part apart.
What emerges in A Part Apart is a portrait of a minoritarian intellectual committed to building a society based on the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity. This entailed resolving the gap between the political principles set forth in the Indian constitution drafted and introduced in 1950 under his leadership, and the reality of social inequality. In an often-quoted speech before the Constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949, he said:
On the 26th of January 1950, we are going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognizing the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. How long shall we continue to live this life of contradictions?
Gopals account meticulously charts Ambedkars attempts to grapple with this life of contradictions. First, he confronted anticolonial nationalism and clashed with Gandhi on whether caste inequality was intrinsically connected to Hinduism. Second, he engaged with constitutional democracy and developed his view of politics as an instrument of social change. Third, his concern with establishing the equality of all human beings is observable in his approach to religion and his eventual turn to Buddhism.
Ambedkar was born in 1891 in the British colonial cantonment town of Mhow, now in Madhya Pradesh in central India. He was the fourteenth and last child of a family belonging to the Dalit Mahar caste. The Mahars were not allowed to draw water from public wells; upper-caste Hindus considered even their shadow polluting. The British colonial army in which his father had served recognized military rank but not the practice of untouchability. This perhaps explains why Ambedkar did not have an entirely negative view of British rule. For him self-rule was not intrinsically better than foreign rule; what mattered more than freedom from colonial domination was freedom from upper-caste domination.
The colonial army offered a modern education to soldiers, even training and recruiting them as teachers. Ambedkar recalled that his father developed a zeal for education, ensuring that all his children learned to read and write. In 1904 the family moved to a two-room tenement in a working-class Mumbai neighborhood where Ambedkar continued his education. He graduated from Bombay University in 1912 and left the next year for Columbia University, supported by a scholarship from the ruler of the princely state of Baroda.
At Columbia, he studied economics, sociology, history, philosophy, and anthropology. In 1915 he wrote a thesis for his MA in economics. While still working on his Columbia doctoral dissertation, he enrolled at the London School of Economics in 1916 for another MA in preparation for a second doctoral degree. He also enrolled in Grays Inn to become a barrister. He left for Mumbai a year later when his scholarship ran out, returning to London in 1920 to obtain an MSc (in economics) in 1921. He was called to the bar in 1922. A year later he submitted his dissertation and received a doctoral degree from the LSE. In 1927 he obtained his second doctorate in economics from Columbia.

By any standard, Ambedkars education was extraordinary, and even more so because of his stringent financial circumstances. In the years between his return to India and his Columbia doctorate, he started journals that launched his career as a public figure while teaching at a Mumbai college to support his family. In Gopals book he emerges as an intellectual intent on transforming Indian public discourse. This commitment came out of experiencing caste bigotry while growing up, such as being told to sit at the back of classrooms and being denied access to the water faucet unless a school employee opened it for him. Even his considerable academic achievements did not exempt him later from several humiliations, including being denied accommodations. In this respect, his time in the US and the UK provided a welcome relief.
New York also introduced Ambedkar to pragmatism, the philosophy of his teacher at Columbia, John Dewey. Several scholars have noted Deweys influence on his ideas on democracy and equality,6 as did Ambedkar himself. (He was hoping to meet with his former teacher in 1952 when Columbia invited him to New York to accept an honorary degree, but Dewey died two days before his arrival.) The philosopher Scott R. Strouds The Evolution of Pragmatism in India is a magnificent study of Ambedkars complex engagement with Deweys ideas, which he reworked to address Indias specific political and social conditions. Stroud calls this creative use of Deweys philosophy Navayana pragmatism, named after Ambedkars Navayana, or new vehicle Buddhism.
Pragmatisms impact on Ambedkar is evident in his 1919 memorandum to the Southborough Committee, appointed by the British government to consider the implementation of constitutional reforms. Ambedkar rejected the claim that Indians formed a community, which was the basis of the nationalist demand for political reforms. He cited a passage from Deweys Democracy and Education that the existence of a community required its members to be like-minded, with aims, aspirations, and beliefs in common. But while Dewey suggested that like-mindedness was fostered by communication, Ambedkar argued that in India it came from belonging to a single social group. And India had a multitude of these groupscastesisolated from one another. With no communication or intermingling, Hindus formed a community only in relation to non-Hindus. Among themselves, caste-mindedness was more important than like-mindedness. Divided between touchables and untouchables, they could become one community only if they were thrown together into associated living, a concept from Dewey.
Above all, Ambedkars memorandum demanded an end to caste inequality. In 1924 he established an organization to represent and advocate for all Dalit castes with the slogan Educate, Agitate and Organise, which he drew from British socialists. This advocacy took on a sharper tone by 1927, when his organization arranged two conferences that catalyzed what came to be known as the Ambedkari chalval (Ambedkarite movement). The actions it took included Ambedkar and other Dalits drinking water from a public tank and symbolically burning the Manusmriti (the Hindu scripture authorizing caste hierarchy). The reaction of upper-caste Hindus was ferocious. Dalits were assaulted, and rituals to purify the defiled spaces were performed.
Ambedkar compared the second of these conferences to the French National Assembly in 1789 and their symbolic actions to the fall of the Bastille. For him the deliberate violation of caste taboos was an assertion of civil rights. He still spoke of Dalits as belonging to Hindu society but warned that if savarnas (castes belonging to the four varnas) opposed change, Dalits would become non-Hindus. What angered him the most was the purification ceremonies, which he saw as an attack on the humanity and sanctity of the Dalit physical body.
Ambedkars demand for social justice put him at odds with the nationalist movement and eventually with Gandhi. In a 1920 editorial he acknowledged that Indians were denied self-development under the British Raj, but that the same could be said of Dalits under the Brahmin raj. He wrote that they had every right to ask, What have you done to throw open the path of self-development for six crore [60 million] Untouchables in the country? He described the Gandhi-led Indian National Congress as political radicals and social Tories whose delicate gentility will neither bear the Englishman as superior nor will it brook the Untouchables as equal.
Clearly the disagreements were deep. Gandhi, like other nationalists, believed that freedom from British rule was the primary goal and that Hindu society could address untouchability after independence had been achieved. Ambedkar, drawing on Deweys ideas on associated life, argued that India was not yet a nation and could not become one without addressing caste injustice. The purpose of politics, in his view, was to enact social change that Hindu society was too caste-ridden to accomplish on its own.
The conflict between the two men came to a head at the Round Table Conferences (RTC) in London, organized by the British to discuss political devolution. Several Congress Party leaders had denounced Ambedkar as a government puppet when he was appointed in 1927 as a nonelected representative of Dalits (whom the British called Depressed Classes) in the Bombay Legislative Council. Their criticism escalated at the second RTC when Ambedkar demanded that Dalits be granted separate constituencies to elect their own representatives to provincial legislatures. The Congress saw this as falling for the classic colonial ploy of divide and rule. It was willing to concede separate electorates for Muslims but not for Dalits. Gandhi was especially opposed to Ambedkars stand because he saw the Dalits, unlike Muslims, as part of Hindu society. He went on a fast to oppose the 1932 Communal Award, an electoral scheme announced by the British government that accepted separate representation for both Muslims and Dalits.
The standoff was resolved only after Ambedkar, Gandhi, and upper-caste leaders signed the Poona Pact that September. Ambedkar dropped his demand for separate electorates and accepted the principle of reserved seats for Dalits elected by joint electorates. From later writings by Ambedkar, in particular Annihilation of Caste and What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (1945), the Poona Pact appears to have been a breaking point between the two men, a view that historians have accepted. But Gopal shows that the picture was more complicated in 1932.
Gandhi saw himself as a champion of Dalits, whom he called Harijans (children of God). He was loath to concede that they were outside Hinduism, like Muslims, and required separate representation. He wanted savarnas to abandon the practice of untouchability by a change of heart. Though Ambedkar appreciated Gandhis efforts, he wanted separate electorates because joint electorates for reserved seats meant that only those candidates acceptable to savarnas would win. But he signed the Poona Pact and accepted the outcome, even if it amounted to a concession.
This, Gopal argues, indicates that the Poona Pact was not a moment of irremediable split. With meticulous research, he shows that Ambedkar was satisfied with it. Though his attitude changed in his later writings, Gopal conclusively demonstrates that he initially regarded the pacts achievements as substantial. He also believed that Gandhis commitment to eliminating untouchability was genuine, even as he disagreed with his methods. He wrote, Gandhiji should be now called our man, because he is now speaking our language and our thoughts. This is at odds with Tharoors contention that ungenerosity toward Gandhi was one of Ambedkars flaws. If anything, it was Ambedkar who showed generosity and political flexibility.
But this amity barely lasted a year. There was a fundamental difference in their respective understandings of caste and its relationship to Hinduism. Gandhi regarded untouchability as an ugly corruption of a basically benign varna system. He called himself a Harijan by choice and turned his attention to uplifting Dalits rather than to the elimination of untouchability or any fundamental change in Hinduism. Ambedkar intensely disliked the Harijan moniker, believing it concealed the real cause of oppression, which was the Hindu varna system. At a conference in 1935 Ambedkar declared that though he was born a Hindu, he would not die as one. A year later he published Annihilation of Caste, the text of an undelivered speech, which argued that caste, along with social hierarchy and untouchability, was essential to Hinduism as a religion.
It was a stinging critique, one that Gandhi did not accept. Tharoor, who also wrote Why I Am a Hindu (2018), regards it as too sweeping, ignoring the religions plural traditions and closing the possibility of any rapprochement. But Tharoor fails to appreciate Ambedkars aim, which was to force Hindus to confront what their religion had wrought. Ambedkar wrote that Hindus treated Dalits horribly not because of some malice in their hearts but because they were religious and were simply following their scriptures. The problem was deep-rooted. At least slaves could hope for emancipation. But there was no hope for Dalits: it was the fatal accident of their birth.
If this religiously sanctioned system of inequality was resistant to emancipatory change, what could be done? This question opens the second theme in Ambedkars preoccupation with a life of contradictions: constitutional democracy and the use of politics to achieve social change. From the start of his public activities, he had used constitutional methods, submitting memoranda to various British committees to recommend reforms and participating in the RTC. Mindful of his standing as a Dalit leader, the Congress Party chose Ambedkar as the chair of the committee to draft the constitution of independent India, which affirmed equality irrespective of caste, religion, language, or birthplace.7 Untouchability was abolished, and seats in the Parliament were reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (the official name for historically disadvantaged groups since 1935). Inspired by the Irish constitution, the Indian constitution also included a section called Directive Principles of State Policy, which outlined broad measures of social welfare. But these did not establish legally enforceable rights; the expectation was that constitutional guidance would result in policies that would realize the goals of equality and fraternity.
Ambedkar observed in 1949 that adopting constitutional democracy meant that we must abandon the bloody methods of revolution. Liberty, equality, and fraternity were to be instituted through constitutional means. Although he had used these tactics himself in the past, he now showed little patience for the stampede of civil disobedience, which he called a grammar of anarchy. Gopal does not provide any explanation for this apparent contradiction. We are left to conclude that Ambedkar was so convinced of Hindu societys resistance to equality that he could place his faith only in the state to transform power relations.
Tharoor criticizes him for this statism, but it was born of Ambedkars experience of upper-caste resistance to fundamental change. Accordingly, he drafted a constitution that equipped the state with vast powers to carry out an expansive social project. The constitution granted fundamental rights, but it also included provisions under which the state could circumscribe them, unencumbered by substantive judicial scrutiny.8 Ambedkar and other framers of the constitution had hoped that constitutional morality would guide state leaders in the future to use these provisions sparingly. But Indira Gandhi used them in 1975 to impose a national Emergency and suspend basic rights, and today the Modi government systematically deploys them to pursue critics and activists it calls anti-national.
Ambedkar was invited by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1950 to join his government as law minister, and he accepted. As minister, he introduced the Hindu Code Bill, which included womens marriage and inheritance rights. The RSS and the Congress Party savarnas opposed it bitterly, especially as a Dalit was proposing a law involving Hindu women. Nehru dithered, the bill stalled, and Ambedkar resigned. He dabbled in politics for a time, though not very successfully. His last years were increasingly devoted to establishing colleges for Dalits, writing, and promoting Buddhism.
His interest in Buddhism developed out of his conviction that religion provided the social conscience without which any rights provided by law remained dead letters. Hinduism could not do this because of its commitment to caste. In his interpretation of Buddhism, called Navayana or Neo-Buddhism, Ambedkar believed he had found a religion for the modern age for three reasons: it upheld reason and experience over the divine word; its moral code recognized liberty, equality, and fraternity; and it refused to ennoble or sanctify poverty as a blessed state. Unlike traditional religions that were concerned with God, the soul, and rituals, Buddhism had no concept of God or the soul, and the Buddha shunned rituals, advocating an inclusive path of righteous and moral living. Ambedkar expressed these ideas in Buddha and His Dhamma, a posthumously published treatise on Buddhas life and philosophy. On October 15, 1956, he took the oath to accept Buddhism in a public meeting with a mass of his followers. He died two months later on December 6, having fulfilled the pledge made in 1935 that he would not die a Hindu.
Although many Dalits did convert to Buddhism, most did not. In any case Ambedkar never clarified how conversion would address conditions of material deprivation and oppression by savarnas. Most Dalits remain poor. They work as agricultural laborers, perform menial jobs, and are housed in settlements separated from savarnas. The political theorist Gopal Guru, quoting V.S. Naipaul, suggests that Dalits continue to be treated as walking carrion. But Ambedkar did help raise Dalits consciousness of their rights. Thanks to Ambedkar, the overt practice of untouchability in public life is frowned upon. The constitutional abolition of untouchability and the provision for reserving positions have changed the political landscape. Democracy has helped members of intermediate and lower castes, including Dalits, climb the ladders of power in government. In many states, particularly in the south, this has resulted in more inclusive governance and welfare. But the Dalits share of wealth and access to professional careers remain minimal, and the experience of social indignity and humiliation persists.
Ambedkars ambition for achieving democracy as a daily practice of equality remains a distant goal, but these books establish the depth and ambition of his ideas and their global relevance. Theorists of democracy and those worried about its crisis around the world could learn from his idea of it as something that goes beyond procedural norms, as a dedication to the free and equal association of all human beings. His frequent invocation of the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity was not formulaic but purposeful. To realize this ambitious ideal, he wished to mobilize the combined forces of law, politics, the state, and religion as morality. Despite their differences, Ambedkar and Gandhi shared an understanding of the importance of conscience in effecting social changerealizing in practice what is written in law.
But there is little hope of this occurring under Modi, whose Hindu nationalist rhetoric has been amplified in the six-week national elections that end on June 1. Modis vitriolic anti-Muslim demagoguery hopes to unite Hindus as a solid voting bloc, but he maintains a deafening silence on Dalit demands for equality. To ensure victory, he imprisons opposition leaders. Political rivals are coerced into joining the BJP following raids on their homes by tax authorities. The BJPs election coffers are flush with corporate donations. Television networks and newspapers, controlled by friendly owners, regularly sing Modis praises and attack the opposition. Critical journalism has been forced to operate precariously on YouTube, in the face of government censorship and the BJPs army of social media bots.
Modi is leaving nothing to chance. The election results, to be announced on June 4, will determine if his government, in power since 2014, will secure a third term. Opposing the BJP is an alliance headed by the Congress Party, which led India to independence and ruled it for nearly sixty-five years. In its election manifesto it warns the country that the BJP is a danger to democracy and promises that it will undertake a caste census to determine the magnitude of economic and social inequality and introduce ameliorative policies. It thereby hopes to overcome Modis appeal to Hindu unity.
Indias democracy and Ambedkars vision of social equality are at stake as Indians vote. Meanwhile Rohith Vermulas mother continues fighting to hold the authorities legally accountable for his death.9 The election will have a significant impact on whether she will get a measure of justice for the young man who fought for Dalit rights and wrote poignantly about the fatal accident of his birth.

Modi held meetings to discuss the unprecedented heat-wave and post-cyclone flood situations in several states. All major exit polls showed that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance will win substantially more seats than the 272 needed for a majority in Indias parliament. Official election results will be released on June 4. While the opposition parties dismissed the exit polls, financial markets cheered the development with the key stock indexes hitting record levels.

Indian President Droupadi Murmu and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar were among the early voters in the nations capital. We want people to vote in huge numbers as the country is making a very big decision, Jaishankar told the media after casting his ballot.
The parliamentary election, which will determine the next government, has been plagued by low voter turnout amid a heatwave and record temperatures in several parts of the country. Overall, around 970 million Indians are eligible to vote.
Rahul and Sonia Gandhi, the leaders of the Indian National Congress, the biggest opposition party in India, also cast their votes in the capital on Saturday. Mother and I contributed to this great festival of democracy by casting our votes, Rahul wrote in a caption to a selfie of the two on X (formerly Twitter).
In the post, he also reiterated the Congress pre-election promises, including jobs for 300,000 young people and a monthly payment of 8,500 India rupees ($102) for poor women, and ridding farmers of debt. Gandhi is running from two constituencies: Wayanad in Kerala and his familys fortress of Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was released on bail earlier this month to campaign in the election, was another prominent leader who voted in the capital. I voted against dictatorship, unemployment and inflation, Kejriwal said after casting his vote.
Kejriwal is the co-founder and leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, which is in power in the Delhi region (the Indian capital has its own legislative assembly and elected government). The politician was arrested in April in an alleged corruption case linked to liquor tax policy. On May 10, the Supreme Court granted Kejriwal temporary bail. He will have to surrender and return to jail on June 2, the day after the six-week election wraps up.

Apart from the nations capital, polling is also being held in the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Haryana.
Meanwhile, turmoil has once again been reported in West Bengal, which is ruled by the All Indian Trinamool Congress party. The ruling partys workers allegedly blocked the car of Agnimitra Paul, a BJP candidate, as she proceeded to vote in the Medinipur constituency, causing clashes, according to Indian media.
The seventh and final round of voting will be held on June 1, and the results declared on June 4.

NEW DELHI  Indiassix-week-long national electioncame to an end Saturday as the last of the countrys hundreds of millions of voters went to the polls for a contest thats widely seen as a referendum on Hindu Nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modis decade in power.
During the grueling, multi-phase election, candidates criss-crossed the country, pollworkers hiked to remote villages, and voters lined up for hours in sweltering heat. Now all thats left is to wait for the results, which are expected to be announced Tuesday.
The election is considered one of the most consequential in Indias history. If Modi wins, hell be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the countrys first prime minister.
Most poll surveys show Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party leading over the broad opposition alliance thats challenging them, led by the Congress party. The votes will be counted Tuesday, with results expected by the end of the day.
Modis campaign began on a platform of economic progress, with vows to uplift the poor and turn India into adeveloped nation by 2047. But it turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as Modiescalated polarizing rhetoricin incendiary speeches that targeted the countrys Muslim minority, who make up 14% of Indias 1.4 billion people.
After campaigning ended on Thursday, Modi went to a memorial site honoring a famous Hindu saint to meditate on national television. The opposition Congress party called it a political stunt and said it violated election rules as the campaigning period has ended.
When the election kicked off in April, Modi and his BJP were widely expected to clinch another term.
Since coming to power in 2014, Modi has enjoyed immense popularity. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved Indias standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the worlds fifth-largest.
At the same time, his rule has seen brazen attacks and hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims.Indias democracy, his critics say, is faltering and Modi has increasinglyblurred the line between religion and state.
But as the campaign ground on, his party faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics and are hoping to benefit fromgrowing economic discontent.
Pre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefitted despite brisk economic growth under Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated.
The seventh round of polls covered 57 constituencies across seven states and one union territory, completing a national election to fill all 543 seats in the powerful lower house of parliament. Nearly 970 million voters  more than 10% of the worlds population. More than 8,300 candidates ran for five-year terms in parliament.
In Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, voters lined up outside polling stations early Saturday morning to avoidthe scorching heat, with temperatures expected to reach 93.2 Fahrenheit. Modi was challenged there by the states chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who heads the regional Trinamool Congress party.
There is a crunch for jobs now in the present market. I will vote for the government that can uplift jobs. And I hope those who cannot get jobs, they will get jobs, said Ankit Samaddar.
In this election, Modis BJP  which controls much of Indias Hindi-speaking northern and central parts sought to expand their influenceby making inroads into the countrys eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.
The BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80% of the population, afterModi opened a long-demanded Hindu templeon the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.
Modi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls, in a move seen as a bid to energize his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the absence of a single big-ticket campaign issue, which Modi has relied on to power previous campaigns.
In 2014, Modis status as a political outsider with plans to crack down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, heswept the polls on a wave of nationalismafter his government launched airstrikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.
But things are different this time, analysts say, giving Modis political challengers a potential opportunity.
The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy. This election, people are voting keeping various issues in mind, said Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst.

With less than two weeks to go before election results are announced, the picture is looking less certain for the popular leader.
Party insiders, opposition members and analysts who have traveled across the country to speak to voters say theres little evidence of a Modi wave that allowed his Bharatiya Janata Party to sweep the polls in 2019. Then, the BJP won 303 of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha. Along with its allies, the BJP-led coalition had about 351 seats.
Modi targeted more than 400 seats for his coalition this time around, a goal emblazoned on campaign posters and one the prime minister frequently plugged in his campaign speeches. But a notable shift in Modis tone after the first phase of voting  where he began using divisive, anti-Muslim language and ramped up attacks against the main opposition groups welfare policies  fueled speculation the BJP may have been spooked by early voting trends and needed to fire up its support base.
Election rules dont allow for any result polls to be published during the six weeks of voting, so its difficult to know with any certainty whether the BJPs support has indeed declined. Indias first-past-the-post electoral system means even small margins can decide the winner. Exit polls wont be published until June 1 with results expected on June 4.
Muddying the waters even further is the fact that both the ruling party and opposition are claiming publicly they have the upper hand. Modi himself told The Economic Times this week that the BJP has already won a majority of the seats in the parliament based on voting in the first five phases of elections so far.
However, behind closed doors a picture is emerging of an opposition alliance thats slightly more optimistic about their likely gains, and a ruling party that appears to be bracing for some losses. The Indian National Congress, the main opposition group, expects to win between 90-110 seats in total, up from 52 in 2019, according to a senior party leader, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The estimates were based on internal polling, the person said.
Three BJP officials from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana states privately admitted that the party is unlikely to match its 2019 figures, although they still expect to win a majority of the seats in parliament. The officials asked not to be identified in order to speak freely about internal matters.
Nalin Kohli, a spokesman for the BJP, said theres no reason why the ruling party and its allies wont significantly increase their results from five years ago given the performance of the Modi government and his leadership. Congress party spokespeople werent immediately available to comment when contacted for further information.
Uncertainty about the poll outcome has already seeped into financial markets, with volatility rising in recent weeks. The India VIX Index  a gauge of likely market swings over the next 30 days  more than doubled from a low in April.
Foreigners pulled $3.5 billion from local shares in May, although there are now signs of global funds ending their bearish view. Indian equities hit a record on Thursday after the central banks generous dividend to the government and Modis comments to The Economic Times of an expected historic mandate.
Majority Mark
Political analysts and economists are less optimistic.
Rahul Verma, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, a New Delhi-based think tank, expects the BJP to stay in power, while winning anywhere between 282 to 310 seats nationally. Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at TS Lombard, was more bearish, saying anecdotal evidence during her recent travels from Indias east to west coast suggests the BJP could possibly fall below the majority mark of 272 seats. With the help of its allies, though, the party will still be able to form the government, she said in a report on May 16.
Reasons for the BJPs slide in support are varied, according to party officials and analysts. Modi has been in power for a decade and has delivered on several of the BJPs key pledges, a key one being the building of a temple in honor of the Hindu god Ram on a site where an ancient mosque once stood. The inauguration of the temple in Ayodhya in January fulfilled a key promise made to the BJPs Hindu nationalist base for decades.
Anecdotal evidence from our travels on the election trail from Indias east coast to its west suggests that Modis popularity has waned somewhat since the Ram temple inauguration in January, when a BJP wave seemed to have swept across India, Deveshwar said. Although multiple factors at play in a country as vast as India make the national mood difficult to read, common themes we picked up on the road include the lack of job creation and rising demand for welfare schemes.
Beyond those, voters concerns have been dominated by the high cost of living and caste identity, observers say. The oppositions heavy focus on improving the welfare of the poor, especially those who belong to the lowest social groups, have resonated with voters, they say.
Modis 400-seat target may have been counter-productive, too, since it might have led to complacency in the BJPs ranks while fueling a belief among lower-caste voters that the BJP will use its parliamentary super-majority to push through changes that reduce affirmative action policies for lower socio-economic groups. Home Minister Amit Shah has consistently denied the party has any such plan, although that hasnt stopped the opposition from exploiting voters anxiety around this.
The shift in momentum was in some evidence in the electorally important state of Uttar Pradesh, considered a stronghold for the BJP after it swept the region with 71 out of 80 seats in 2014 and won 62 in the 2019 elections.
Akhilesh Yadav, leader of the Samajwadi Party, the biggest opposition group in Uttar Pradesh, has been drawing significant crowds to political rallies, where he campaigns alongside alliance members, like the Congress party and the Trinamool Congress. The alliance parties have agreed not to contest seats against each other, allowing them to consolidate the opposition vote against the BJP.
WATCH: How India's Leader Is Preparing for a 1,000-Year Legacy
Yadav and Rahul Gandhi, the face of the Congress party, were due to address a rally together earlier this week in a town in Uttar Pradesh, but were forced to leave after throngs of supporters rushed the stage to see the two leaders, pushing through police barricades.
The two men, relatively young leaders in their 50s, represent change for the voters who are disillusioned with the decade-long rule of 73-year-old Modi. Heading into a third term, the brand value of Modi isnt there and the opposition is putting up a strong fight in Uttar Pradesh, said Sunita Aron, an author of three books on Indian politics, including a biography on Yadav.
The body language between Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi shows theyre friendly, they share a camaraderie, said Aron, who was an executive editor for the Hindustan Times in Uttar Pradesh for more than two decades. If the two leaders are standing on a stage, holding hands, that sends a message to the cadres on the ground that were coordinating, were working together.
Uttar Pradesh was once again seen as a walkover for the BJP when the election began, but Aron said theres now at least 25-30 seats in contention for the opposition.
The BJP has an edge, but the alliance is giving it a good fight, she said.
The clamor for change was evident on Tuesday at a rally in the rural town of Bhadohi, in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Flying in on a helicopter that sent dust clouds high up in the air, Yadav was cheered on by more than 8,000 supporters, predominantly young men, waiting in 40-degree heat to catch a glimpse of the leader, campaigning there on behalf of a candidate from the Trinamool Congress.
Yadav told his supporters the alliance will increase government jobs and waive loans for farmers, prompting huge roars from the crowd. In an interview after his speech, he criticized the Modi government for its policies and said the ruling party was losing support because of rising joblessness and inflation. He said the opposition alliance was aligned on its priorities, including improving affirmative action policies for the lowest caste groups.
He predicted the BJP will lose its majority and the opposition will form the government.
The BJP route to power was through Uttar Pradesh, now they are losing all seats and that will be their end, Yadav said.

The mammoth of a six-week-long election in India has recommenced, as the main opponents of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who have accused him of unfairly singling them out for criminal investigations, are set to cast their votes in the capital city of New Delhi.
Elections were being held on Saturday for 58 seats in constituencies in the Union Territory of Delhi, and the states of Bihar, Bengal, Haryana, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir's last constituency, where the polling was rescheduled from the third to the sixth phase.
The upcoming election in the national capital of Delhi is expected to be highly competitive, especially after septuagenarian Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won all seven seats in 2019.
This time, one of Modi's opponents and Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is aiming to secure a few seats.
Kejriwal, 55, a prominent figure in a diverse coalition aiming to overthrow the BJP, was imprisoned for several weeks this year due to an ongoing corruption investigation.
Earlier this month, Kejriwal was granted bail by the Supreme Court, enabling him to resume his campaign for his party. He is now fervently urging Indians to cast their votes against what he has labeled as an emerging ""dictatorship"".
""Modi has started a very dangerous mission,"" he said soon after his release. ""Modi will send all opposition leaders to jail.""
AAP is competing for four seats in Delhi, while its ally and India's main opposition party, Congress, is contesting for three seats.
In February, officials suspended multiple bank accounts belonging to Congress as a result of an ongoing disagreement regarding income tax filings from five years prior.
The party's Rahul Gandhi, the scion of a family that ruled India for decades and Modi's main competitor, stated that the action has significantly hindered the party's capacity to participate in the election.
By the end of Saturday, the election process will have concluded in 486 out of the 543 Lok Sabha seats (the lower house of the parliament). Additionally, the polling will have been completed in Haryana, Delhi, and Jammu and Kashmir.
With close to a billion people eligible to vote, India is conducting voting in seven stages spread out over a period of six weeks in order to alleviate the significant logistical challenges associated with organizing an election in the most populous nation on Earth. For the seventh and last phase, 57 seats will be left to be contested.
The vote tallying will take place on June 4 following the conclusion of the final stage of the election on June 1.

"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Priyanka Shankar,They stole our jobs and life: Anger and desperation in Indias coal belt,People living in the coal belt in West Bengal say their demands are unheard as India elects its government.,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/5/28/they-stole-our-jobs-and-life-anger-desperation-along-indias-coal-belt,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/0H1A2983-1715251965.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,2024-05-28T08:17:41Z,"People living in the coal belt in West Bengal say their demands are unheard as India elects its government.
West Bengal and Jharkhand, India  Amar Baran Paul can never forget how the ground below him shook and more than 25 houses around him collapsed four years ago in Harishpur town in eastern Indias West Bengal state.
Harishpur is located near the Madhabpur opencast coal mine  where coal is extracted from the surface of the ground and not by digging the ground  operated by Eastern Coalfield Limited (ECL). It is in the Asansol-Raniganj coal belt in West Bengals Paschim Bardhaman district, about a six-hour drive from the state capital, Kolkata.
The belt, which has 146 villages, has been extensively mined since the 17th century, and land subsidence incidents like the one in Harishpur, which occurred when the ground near the opencast mine collapsed, are common in the area.
In July 2020, the road nearing our township suddenly sank and cracks began emerging on houses near this road. Soon after, we could feel tremors and the walls of some houses began falling, Paul, a retired ECL employee, told Al Jazeera. More than 20 people lost their homes overnight.
Sitting on the verandah of his home where the cracks on the walls were clearly visible, Paul said more than 400 residents were forced to flee Harishpur after the land subsidence. Pauls family found a house on rent near the town but the steep rent made them return to their damaged home.
I have a son who is 29 and disabled. I have to prioritise his safety. Living in Harishpur I constantly worry that if the ground sinks again because of the opencast mine, my sons life will be in danger, said Paul, who belongs to the Jadhav caste, fallingunder the Other Backward Class (OBC)  a collective term used by the Indian government to classify castes that are educationally or socially backward. The village also houses people from Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs)  other government classifications for historically disadvantaged communities.
Accentuating the sense of vulnerability among thesecommunities in Harishpur is a sense of neglect.
The state government and politicians came here four years ago promising support and encouragement. But since then our voices remain unheard. Our demands for compensation for the land we have lost and houses damaged have also not been met, said Paul, explaining how they have held hunger strikes, boycotted local elections and protested by blocking national highways to ensure their demands are met. All in vain.
An hours drive from Harishpur, 71-year-old Manik Bauri and his family live in the village of Rakhakura, which is also in the Paschim Bardhaman district, near a mine operated by Integrated Coal Mining Limited (ICML), owned by RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group.
Since the opencast mine was developed on our land, we have all become land losers. Weve lost what we own to coal companies and in return are left with polluted air to breathe, toxic water to drink, a truckload of health problems and no jobs, Bauri told Al Jazeera.
Politicians want the money from the coal projects. They dont care about us.
Bauris house lies adjacent to the mine and is one among about 500 houses in Rakhapura. A smell similar to that of ash after a wildfire engulfs the atmosphere in the village and coal dust envelops the floor of every terrace and verandah.
Our health gets affected by inhaling the coal dust-tinted air. Diseases like tuberculosis and eczema are common here. Even if we shut the windows, the [coal] dust comes in and when there is blasting at the mine, our entire house shakes, Madhivi Bauri, Maniks 45-year-old sister, told Al Jazeera.
Samit Kumar Carr, secretary-general of the Occupational Safety & Health Association of Jharkhand (OSHAJ), a nonprofit that works with coal miners, said unprotected open cast, underground coal mining sites and coal-based power generation plants pose specific health risks to workers and the community living near the mines.
Many of them who inhale coal dust which contains carbon over both short and long periods suffer from coal workers pneumoconiosis (CWP), which is an irreversible, incurable, and progressive occupational lung disease, representing a specific form of pneumoconiosis, he told Al Jazeera.
Traditionally, the coal belt is also home to some of Indias poorest communities, which suffer from malnutrition. That makes them more vulnerable to tuberculosis if they are affected by CWP, Carr said.
Madhivi Bauris 30-year-old daughter-in-law Asha Bauri said she fears for their childrens future and hopes to leave the village.
Besides the health effects, there are no jobs here. In many households, young people have begun leaving the village. We were all once able to cultivate crops on this land but now the soil is polluted and we are left jobless, she said.
The West Bengal constituencies where Harishpurs Paul and Rakhakuras Bauris live voted on May 13 in the fourth phase of Indias mammoth seven-phase election which began on April 19.
The state is currently under the rule of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress (TMC), which is competing against Prime Minister Narendra Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main governing party ruling federally.
Staring at the mine  which resembles a low-lying hill  near his house and describing how the mine lights up with fire at night after blasting ends just before sunset, Manik Bauri lamented that no politician cares about them.
They stole our jobs and life by putting up a mine here, he said.
Indias coal industry was nationalised by then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1973. The blanket order applied to all the coal mines in the country and ensured that coal mining would be exclusively reserved for the public sector. However, the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973 was amended in 1993 to allow limited private-sector participation in coal mining.
Nationalisation formalised the industry and, in turn, boosted the black sedimentary rocks monetary value politically, according to Gareth Price, a senior research fellow at the Irish think tank The Azure Forum for Contemporary Security Strategy.
Earlier, a lot of local groups were in charge of the different mines but after nationalisation, there was a degree of organisation and the money went to the national government, he said.
But the debate around boosting coal was framed around the fact that people in India need access to power and hence coal-fired power stations have to exist, he told Al Jazeera, adding that the real reason which is monetary, continues to be masked.
In theory, cheap renewable energy could replace Indias dependence on coal. But at the moment, that is a long way off for some of the countrys most coal-dependent regions.
However in the big coal belts like Raniganj in West Bengal and in the Indian state of Jharkhand, there are few other sources of revenue. So entire villages, businesses and politicians depend on the coal sector to earn a livelihood. This makes phasing out coal a challenge since livelihoods are at stake, he said.
India is currently the second largest producer of coal. To cut down on coal imports, the Modi government has been leasing out coal mines to private companies. According to the countrys Ministry of Coal, 104 blocks have been auctioned under commercial mining.
Coal India, a state-run near-monopoly, has also ramped up production, with 703.20 million tonnes being produced during the 2022-23 financial year compared with 622.63 million tonnes being produced in 2021-22.
The government has also cancelled many passenger trains  the lifeblood of rural India which provides cheap travel options for its poor  to expedite the passage of trains ferrying coal from mines to power plants.
Anup Das, 22, who lives in a village along West Bengals Barabani railway station in Paschim Bardhaman district, welcomed the coal projects. The coal sliding along this track is a private project.
My entire livelihood depends on the functioning of Indias coal sector, he told Al Jazeera.
Clad in a fake branded T-shirt and surrounded by his friends near the railway track, Das explained how, due to the lack of other jobs in the region, everyone is directly or indirectly involved in working in the coal sector, even if it harms their health and the environment  and even if they lose their land in the process.
But all of us cannot get directly employed by the coal companies since we are illiterate or under-skilled. So we have found a career in the illegal coal smuggling business where we carry bags of coal we steal from the mines to factories on bikes or cycles, Das said.
It is the only way to earn money to put food on our plates.
According to a 2019 report by the Press Trust of India news agency, throughout the Asansol-Raniganj belt, in about 3,500 illegal coal mines, at least 35,000 people are directly employed (work in the mines), while another 40,000 get indirect employment (involved in supplying the coal to factories or are involved in handling coal hauling). Illegal mines do not have the governments permission to exist. People working in them are also not given any official employment papers.
Munna Jha*, 35, a coal trader in the region, told Al Jazeera that these days, much of the coal stolen by people like Das originates from legal mines. He claimed that political parties benefit from the illegal coal business  getting cuts of the illicit profits. Al Jazeera could not independently confirm this claim.
In these open cast mines, as soon as the blasting process  done by the mining companies which have won tenders from the government to mining for them  takes place, over 200 people [in each site] assemble at a spot and illegally collect the coal. They load the coal on cycles or bikes and transfer it to private warehouses from where they are loaded on trucks and transported to iron and steel factories, Jha said.
The illegal coal typically fetches 30 percent less than the price of the legal coal  but it is still better than no income for Das and others like him.
West Bengal Chief Minister Banerjee has repeatedly promised to end the illegal coal trade and increased police checks on vehicles suspected of smuggling coal.
Local daily The Statesman reported that, during an election rally in Raniganj on May 10, Modis Home Minister Amit Shah alleged that the TMC was linked with the coal mafia.
But Narendra Nath Chakraborty, district president of the TMC, claimed that it is the BJP which encourages the illegal coal mining in Raniganj coalfield area.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has taken a strong stance against the coal mafia after she came to power in 2011, he claimed.
Swaraj Das, an activist from the Project Affected Peoples Association  a group comprising people who have been affected by coal mines  emphasised the need for investment in education and jobs in the region so people living near mines can end their dependence on the coal industry. But politicians across parties, he alleged, benefitted from the corruption in the coal industry.
This is why they are not actually taking steps to phase out coal, which is harmful to the environment and is also stealing peoples land, he told Al Jazeera.
We have been protesting against open cast mining for years and currently spend time documenting the sordid living conditions of people living near the mines, and the illegal activities taking place in these mines to raise awareness about the dangers of coal mining, he said.
India needs to focus on continuing to invest in green energy like solar panels or generating energy through the sea. These methods will not displace people and make them lose their land either, he said.
There has also been pressure on India from the West and the United Nations to phase out coal to tackle climate change.
While Prime Minister Modi made lofty promises at the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, triggering hope among environmentalists and activists that most of Indias abundant reserves of low-quality coal would never get to the surface, the countrys dependence on coal continues to grow.
In 2023, growth in coal-fired electricity generation outpaced green energy output for the first time since 2019. According to Grid India, power generation from coal and lignite between 2023 and 2024 rose by 13.9 percent compared with a 9.7 percent increase in renewable energy sources.
Meanwhile, some Adivasi communities  Indias Indigenous people, many of whom live in tribes  have taken matters into their own hands and have begun stopping the expansion of coal projects, in an effort to tackle climate change and secure their land rights.
In the village of Hirapur in Jharkhands Dhanbad district, about a three-hour drive from the border of West Bengal, Mangal Murmu, who is an Adivasi, described how the community fought against the Deucha Pachami coal mine project, a public project under the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited (WBPDCL), which Chief Minister Banerjee has been trying to revive since 2021.
As Adivasis, we have a culture where we get together and play tumac [traditional instrument]. This is like our call sign for trouble in the village. So when we heard an opencast mine was going to be constructed on our land which could displace us, we played the tumac and went out to protest, Murmu told Al Jazeera.
More than 9,000 Indigenous people have protested against the trans-state opencast mining project. Those protests have slowed down the progress of the implementation of the $297m project as developers have not been able to reach the land near the Adivasi community. If fully implemented, it could become Asias largest coal mine and the second largest in the world.
Sitting along a glistening stream that passes through his hut, Murmu pulled out his bow and arrow and displayed how they used it to drive coal mine developers away from their land.
There is a thought in India that where Adivasis are, there is something below the ground they live on. So coal companies will come to grab our land, but we are steadfast in our fight for our rights and land, he said.
Maku Hazda, 32, who lives in Sagar Bandi village, not too far from Hirapur, led the Adivasi womens fight against the project.
We stood in a line on our land and had policemen beat us. But we used sticks, bows and arrows and fought them back. I was even arrested but have now been granted bail. Our fight for land will continue till we die, she said.
For Kkokan Mardi, 53, such coal projects also pose long-term questions.
The government keeps saying that if there is coal, there will be electricity. But what happens once this coal under the land we are living on ends? What happens to all these expensive projects? Mardi, who also lives in Sagar Bandi, told Al Jazeera. As people from Indigenous communities, we value nature and its resources and installing mines which lead to land grabbing, health issues, environmental degradation and climate change, is not the way forward.
Give the Adivasis more power and a seat in the government and we will bring about sustainable solutions which also protect our fundamental rights and the climate, he said.

The world's largest election may become the hottest on Saturday, as Indians participate in the next-to-last phase of voting with temperatures forecast to surge to 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) in the capital New Delhi.
More than 111 million people in 58 constituencies across eight states and federal territories are eligible to vote in the sixth of the seven-stage general election, including in the capital territory and the northern swing states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Officials are concerned that the heatwave in parts of northern India, including Delhi and neighboring Haryana state, could discourage voters from going to the polls and standing in lines, in an election earlier marked by low turnout.
""There is a concern, but we hope that people will overcome the fear of the heat wave and come and vote,"" Delhi Chief Electoral Officer P Krishnamurthy told Reuters.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leader of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is favored to win a third consecutive term, a feat previously achieved only by independence hero Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister.
Voting began on April 19 and will conclude on June 1, with counting set for June 4.
Among those eligible to vote in Delhi are Rahul Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party and Modi's main rival, Gandhi's Italian-born mother Sonia Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Vadra.
Rahul Gandhi is contesting elections in the southern state of Kerala and the family bastion of Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh, both of which have already voted. India allows people to contest more than one seat but they can retain only one if they win.
Also eligible to vote is opposition leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, whose bail after pre-trial detention of nearly two months in a graft case has given fresh impetus to the opposition campaign.
Turnout was low in the initial phases of the election but it has improved as the Election Commission (EC), celebrities and politicians repeatedly urged people to vote.
Modi called on people, especially women and youth, to ""vote in large numbers"" in a message on social media platform X on Saturday morning. ""Democracy thrives when its people are engaged and active in the electoral process.""
The EC has deployed thousands of paramedics with medicines and oral hydration salts at polling stations in Delhi. Voting centres have also been equipped with mist machines, shaded waiting areas and cold water dispensers for voters who may have to wait in lines for hours in the sweltering heat.
Among the areas voting on Saturday is the business hub of Gurugram in Haryana, which has offices of half the Fortune 500 companies and witnessed Hindu-Muslim clashes that killed seven people last year.
Religion has occupied centre stage in campaigning, with Modi accusing opposition leaders of being pro-Muslim - a move analysts say aims to fire up his Hindu nationalist base - and the opposition accusing the prime minister of targeting the minority community.
The EC on Wednesday directed the BJP and Congress to exercise restraint in their campaigns.

Modi called on people, especially women and youth, to ""vote in large numbers"" in a message on social media platform X on Saturday morning. ""Democracy thrives when its people are engaged and active in the electoral process.""
Modi is feeling the heat already. Looks like the poor turnout means his aim of winning 400 seats is evaporating into thin air.
Religion has occupied centre stage in campaigning, with Modi accusing opposition leaders of being pro-Muslim
So he is reverting to the tried and tested strategy of scaring his support base into voting for him. But demagoguery can only take you so far.
Good luck to the worlds largest democracy in your elections!
the opposition accusing the prime minister of targeting the minority community.
'targeting the minority community' has been a tactic used by demagogues throughout history, and currently used around the globe in other nations besides India. Divide and conquer, is a quick way to undermine democracy, and launch civil  wars, and also regional conflicts. Scary watching nations around the planet leaning more toward fascism, but it could be lots of people want a big brother making choices for them, and want big brother to slay their enemies, real and imagined. A shoe for every foot, after all.
Scary watching nations around the planet leaning more toward fascism,
One of the globe's demagogue wannabes is calling for his nation to be a 'unified reich', but how 'unified' can  a country be when one group holds all the power, ala J.S Mill's 'tyranny of the majority'.

"{'id': 'rt', 'name': 'RT'}",RT,The bloodline: How political dynasties are threatening the worlds largest democracy,"In India, where nearly a billion are eligible to vote for the new government, dynasties continue to dominate the political landscape Read Full Article at RT.com",https://www.rt.com/india/596974-political-dynasties-india-election/,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/6635df7d85f5401ea03ce339.jpg,2024-05-04T07:51:56Z,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi calls parivaarvad, or dynastic politics, the biggest enemy of democracy. And yet India,which is pursuingits Lok Sabha (parliamentary lower house) election, is rife with examples of political inheritances.
For instance, Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the incumbent Member of Parliament from Kaiserganj, UP, was dropped on Thursday by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in a bid to deflect public anger over public accusations of sexual harassment by Olympic wrestlers; he was replaced withhis son.
On Friday, the opposition Indian National Congress announced that Rahul Gandhi would take part in the election in Raebareli, UP. This seat was represented by his grandfather Feroze Gandhi in 1952 and 1957; his grandmother, former PM Indira Gandhi in 1967, 1971 and 1980; and his mother Sonia Gandhi from 2004 until this year. Rahuls great-grandfather was Indias first PM, Jawaharlal Nehru.
Another former PM, H. D. Deve Gowda, is fending off critics afterseveralsexual assault casessurfaced involving his grandson Prajwal Revanna, the incumbent MP and candidate in Hassan, Karnataka. He belongs to a party in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and PM Modi has been quick to strongly condemn the young man, who has fled India for Germany.
While parivaarvad is a useful dig during election rallies, politicians from across the spectrumtap sons, daughters, wives, brothers, sisters, parents and even sons-in-law and daughters-in-law as candidates with a view to retain or expand their political clout and wealth. 

In the western state of Maharashtra, the Baramati constituency is witnessing a high-stakes political battle.The incumbent MP, Supriya Sule, the daughter of the 83-year-old clan patriarch Sharad Pawar, is opposed by Sunetra Pawar, wife of Ajit Pawar, Sule's cousin and Sharad Pawars nephew, who was once seen as his political successor.
They are fighting because their parent party, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), headed by Sharad Pawar, split 11 months ago, when Ajit, tiring of waiting for his turn and suspicious that his uncle would ultimately ditch him for Supriya, took his faction and joined hands with the BJP to form a new state government.
Baramati is hardly the outlier. Maharashtra sends 48 elected members to the Lok Sabha; candidates in at least 31 of these constituencies belong to political families or have relatives who are former or incumbent MPs, members of a legislative assembly, elected representative to a local body, etc. In a handful of these, as in Baramati, the two main contenders are both dynasts.
In the financial capital Mumbai, which has six parliamentary constituencies, members of political families will take the field in five. Most prominent among these is the BJP candidate from Mumbai North: Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, whose father Ved Prakash Goyal was the BJP treasurer for decades.
In Jalgaon, an agrarian district in northern Maharashtra, Karan Patil-Pawar, the grandson of a former Congress leader and nephew of an incumbent state legislator, will take on state legislator Smita Wagh, whose late husband was the district president of the BJP.
Campaigning for Patil-Pawar in the town of Amalner, Manoj Patil, a former municipal councilor, said emphatically that local voters do not care if their candidate is from a political family.
On the contrary, people themselves often ask the offspring of senior leaders to take over the mantlethese youngsters, like Karan, can be capable leaders with an instinctive knowledge of how to respond to public needs and get things done, he said.
In any case, Smita Wagh was herself grooming her daughter Bhairavi for a meaty role in district electoral politics, so she could hardly use her opponent Karans family privilege against him.
In Baramatis family drama, the entire Pawar clan, a large family controlling sugar cooperatives, banks, businesses and various industrial investments, has rallied behind the patriarch. Ajit Pawars own brother has crossed over and allied with the uncle, to ensure that the veterans image is not slighted. Ajit, currently Maharashtras deputy chief minister, has had to lament at public meetings that he has been abandoned by the extended family.
Sakshana Salgar, a district-level elected representative, and state president of the Nationalist Yuvati Congress, a political wing for young women initiated by Supriya, said voters in Baramati viewed the unfolding battle as if it were the mythological battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas,cousins who wage an 18-day war-to-the-end in an Armageddon-like good versus evil tale called the Mahabharata, written around the 4th Century BCE.   

Political families are not unique to Indialand-owning families have won elections and controlled resources in the Philippines where at least three recent presidents had parents who were presidents too; in Cambodia, the ruler since 1985 handed over the prime ministership to his son; and in North Korea, rulers have all come from one clan.
Political succession within the family helps control the nuts and bolts of the local political economy which works to bring wealth to the political elite and also, simultaneously, helps perpetuate political power for the wealthy. That is why Maharashtras big political dynasties are also barons of industry, private education, agricultural cooperatives, etc. Others control large caste groups, eventually also controlling resources. 
Ruben Mascarenhas, 35, the working president of the Mumbai unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Indias youngest national political party that has disrupted a traditional landscape of politicians with its breed of educated professionals including many from working class backgrounds, said dynasty politics makes for a very high entry barrier in the mainstream parties. 
Its sad that the political landscape has always been feudal, he said. Unlike in the western world, most political parties in India do not offer their cadres the opportunity to rise through the ranks.
The AAP is a political start-up and the only party to offer such upward mobility based entirely on work and merit, he said. Without a system of primaries, first-generation politicians like him, born to hard-working middle-class parents, without a political pedigree, face an unlevel playing field.
I couldnt have imagined this, at this age, without pots of money and without being some kind of antisocial element, to be the head of a city unit of any other political party, he added.

Besides the Pawars, also in the fray in Maharashtra are the Vikhe-Patils and Mohite-Patils of western Maharashtra who are agrarian satraps. The Vikhe-Patils are descendants of Vitthalrao Vikhe Patil, the founder of the cooperative movement in the Indian sugar industry. Based in Ahmednagar, the family has been in politics ever since, and are known for constantly jumping parties. Similarly, Shankarrao Mohite Patil, the patriarch of his clan, started the cooperative movement in drought-prone Solapur district. His son Vijaysinh Mohit-Patil was a deputy CM of Maharashtra, and his nephew Dhairyasheel Mohite-Patil is contesting the current election. His grandson Ranjitsinh Mohit-Patil is waiting in the wings.
Mumbais Thackerays comprise the best known political family in Indias financial capital. Patriarch Balasaheb Thackeray, grew the Shiv Sena with a son-of-the-soil rhetoric that called for the removal of first south Indians, then north Indians, and then Muslims. His son Uddhav was chief minister of Maharashtra (2019-2022) till his party split. Cousin Raj has floundered after a promising start in the 1990s. Uddhavs son Aditya is an important member of their Shiv Sena faction.
Pankaja Munde, whose family has represented the other backward castes (OBC) in the arid heart of central Maharashtra, is contesting the election from Beed. Her father Gopinath Munde died in a car accident after becoming a minister in Modis 2014 government. He was married to the sister of an important member of the BJP brain trust, Pramod Mahajan, who was shot dead in his Mumbai apartment by his brother Pravin in 2006.
Two grandsons of Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, the dalit leader who is called the father of the Indian Constitution, are contesting too  Prakash Ambedkar from Akola and Anandraj Ambedkar from Amravati.
The Congresss candidate in Kolhapur is Chhatrapati Shrimant Shahu Maharaj (Chhatrapati is Marathi for emperor), a direct descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji, the 17th century Maratha warrior king.
Younger politicians without political lineage do not shy away from offering kin a foot in the door. The Congress candidate in Chandrapur was Pratibha Dhanorkar, a state legislator who entered politics after her husband was elected to parliament in 2019. After his sudden demise, she was fielded from his seat in the first phase of the 2024 polls.
On the fringes of Mumbai, in the Kalyan constituency, state chief minister Eknath Shindes son Shrikant Shinde will try to defend his seat, having entered politics on the footsteps of his father, creating a new political family. 
Mascarenhas said Indians unfortunately view leaders as elected maharajahs, leaving some deep-rooted questions about what this means for a vibrant democracy where the election process is a genuine, bona fide exercise, there is peaceful transition of power, but an inability to stem the erosion of democratic institutions while dynasts continue to serve family interests.

A response team was sent in, but no suspicious items were found.
All necessary protocols were followed, and the aircraft was taken to a remote bay as per guidelines by airport security agencies, IndiGo said.
All 176 passengers disembarked through an emergency door and an alternative flight was arranged, according to the carrier.
The incident comesamid fervent election campaigning in Varanasi, the constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where polling will be held on June 1 in the seventh and final phase of the country's parliamentary election.

Two prominent opposition figures  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav  are currently campaigning in the holy city.
On May 15, a noteinscribed withbomb was found in the lavatory of an Air India flight from New Delhi to Vadodara in Gujarat state, NDTV reported, citing police. The note turned out to be a hoax.
Earlier this month, nearly 100 schools as well as hospitals and other public institutions in the Indian capital and other states, including Gujarat, received a bomb threat and were promptly evacuated. The threat was reportedly sent by email, from the address sawariim@mail.ru, which appears to be registered with a Russian provider. The Indian Home Ministry later described it as a hoax and urged people not to panic. Security was ramped up in the Indian capital after the incident.

"{'id': 'rt', 'name': 'RT'}",RT,Flight club: How Modi mobilized Indians overseas to his advantage in the election,"Indian citizens living abroad have been mobilized into an effective force by PM Modi, and are returning home to vote Read Full Article at RT.com",https://www.rt.com/india/597772-india-election-nri-voting/,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/6647283285f5404fc3204d5a.jpg,2024-05-17T11:36:56Z,"Non-Resident Indian Mahesh Murthy has lived in Hong Kong, the US, the Netherlands, and the UAE for over 15 years. But his Indianness hasnt faded. Sitting 2,540km away in Dubai, he follows all political developments, government policy announcements, and the decisions that impact 1.44 billion Indians, every day.
What hes seen and heard over mainstream news and social media, and in conversations with friends and relatives, has helped shape his opinion aboutevents in his motherland. Now, its showtime.
Murthy is one of the many Indian citizens living abroad, commonly referred to as NRIs (Non-Resident Indians), who have flown into India from around the world to exercise their right to vote.
The 2024 Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) election is the first time that over 118,000 overseas Indians have registered to vote. A majority are from the five southern states  Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. This marks a 65% surge from the 2019 election. Thousands have arrived or will arrive shortly. Women account for 11%.
I believe that the governments role is solely to create the conditions and environment for its citizens to live up to their fullest potential, Murthytold RT. Healthcare, food, education, infrastructure, technology, and regulations that allow ease of doing business should be among the top priorities.
This will be the fourth election Murthyhas voted in. He traveled from overseas to vote in two of them, and was here for the May 13 vote in his hometown, Hyderabad, in Telangana.Voting to me is exercising my right to help select my representative in the country, says Murthy, who runs an ad agency and is an investor in many companies, including one in Hyderabad that builds satellites and space tech solutions.
Murthy grew up in a family whose members served in Indias armed forces. Back then, religion, caste and language made little difference to us. Todays India is very different, says Murthy.
Data analysis by the Election Commission of India shows that 74.9% of NRIs who newly registered to vote this time are from Kerala. Andhra Pradesh is next with 6.4%, Maharashtra with 4.7%, and Tamil Nadu and Telangana with 2.9% each.
According to Ministry of External Affairs data, more than 30 million Indians are settled across the globe. Of these, nearly 13.5 million are NRIs, while the remaining are Overseas Citizens of India (OCI)  people who are not citizens of India but have Indian ancestry.
India has the biggest diaspora in the world, followed by Mexico, Russia, and China.
In the 2014 election, when the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, over 11,800 NRIs registered to vote, but less than 1% actually turned up. Similarly, in 2019, as many as 99,807 NRIs registered to vote, of which only 25,000 ended up doing so.
Until 2010, NRIs were not eligible to vote. That year, the government amended a law allowing NRIs who had lived abroad for over six months to vote. Now, an NRI settled in a foreign land can get onto the electoral rolls in India.
New Delhis outreach to the NRIs has changed, too. Modi interacts with the diaspora wherever he travels. In May 2023, the prime minister was welcomed to Sydney stadium by 20,000 cheering fans. Modi shared the stage with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The last time I saw someone on the stage here was Bruce Springsteen and he didnt get the welcome that Prime Minister Modi has got, Albanese told the audience.
In June 2023, Modi addressed the Indian diaspora at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Centre in Washington DC. The mega event began with award-winning singer Mary Millben performing Indias National Anthem.
Similarly, in February this year, Modi addressed thousands of Indians in Abu Dhabi, UAE, where he inaugurated the grand Swaminarayan temple. The enthusiasm of the Indian diaspora was overwhelming, the Times of India reported, with the organizers having to close registration for the event when the numbers surpassed 65,000.

Overseasvoter Maruthi Prasad Surapaneni is excited to cast his vote. He is one of 1,500 NRIs who returned to Andhra Pradesh in the past month to do so. For them, it is an opportunity to vote in the state assembly election as well as the national parliamentary election at the same time, on May 13.
No one can match Modi, India needs him,Prasad declared. He owns a restaurant and is involved in real estate in Melbourne, Australia, where hemoved more than two decades ago.
I have analyzed the performance of both center and state governments and I am here to do my bit in selecting good and capable leaders, says Prasad. Obviously, I want my state and country to grow in all spheres, especially investments, job opportunities and better infrastructure.
NRI Gangadhar Gutta, 50, who has been based in Delaware in the US for the past 17 years, returned to Gudivada, Andhra Pradesh two weeks ago. Like many Andhraites, I have come here to save democracy,the IT professional says.
Soon after arriving, he went around town to speak with a cross-section of people to get a first-hand idea of how things are under the current government: From what I saw and heard, there was nothing to be happy or feel good about. My vote will be my answer to all of that.

Political analyst Rajalakshmi Joshi says the Indian diaspora is keenly looking at the elections primarily due to the ruling partys foreign policy, which has an impact on Indians around the globe, particularly considering the migration policies where they live.
These elections will determine Indias role in addressing regional and global challenges and the diaspora recognizes this, she says.
Joshi says the prime minister also recognized early on the concerns of the diaspora, and his consistent outreach to it has been a feature of his foreign policy.
Addressing tens of thousands of people of Indian origin in Australia, the US, the UAE, Japan and elsewhere, Modi has effectively created a novel tool of foreign policy, backed by enthusiastic supporters abroad, she says.
India has deepened trade relations with Russia, while also continuing to improve ties with the US. With high-octane, visible state visits and vital defense agreements, Indias relations with several countries today are closer than ever, she adds.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi too has been on visits to universities and much publicized talks, with a lesser number of attendees in comparison, but both major parties have realized that their connection to the NRIs is vital to their support, monetarily and otherwise,Joshi says.
To judge the impact overseas voters might have on the election, Joshi points to the winning margin in Kerala in 2019. Only five constituencies had winning margins of less than 50,000 votes, with two of less than 12,000. But in a tightly-fought election, as might be the case in Kerala, with the United Democratic Front (led by the Congress) and the Left Democratic Front (led by the Communist Party of India  Marxist) in a bitter duel, every vote counts, she says.
In other states, NRI votes could impact seats with a close margin, she predicts.
Joshi says Modis target of 400+ seats has mobilized BJP workers across the globe to come to India to campaign and support the BJP. There have been numerous rallies, marathons and walks in support of Modi in various cities of the US, the UK, Germany, the Philippines, the UAE, etc with the goal to see him as PM for the third consecutive time.
While the BJP has hailed the 2024 Lok Sabha election as one for the progress of the country with a vision for 2047,the Opposition has given a call to save democracy and protect the constitution.NRIs from both sides of the divide are hence queuing up,the political analyst says.
That the number of overseasvoters has increased tenfold in ten years is an indicator that the diaspora has woken up to the power of its vote.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of amplifying divisive rhetoric during the countrys election campaign by calling Muslim votes Vote Jihad to encourage Hindus to vote for his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is seeking a historic third term.
Modi told a BJP rally last Tuesday in the central Madhya Pradesh province that voters would have to carefully choose between ""Vote Jihad"" and ""Ram Rajya."" The term, meaning ""Rams Governance,"" refers to an ideal society characterized by equality, prosperity and justice. In recent years, some have come to believe this ideal can only be achieved through the rise of the BJP.
""At this important turning point in history you have to decide whether you will allow Vote Jihad to continue or, vote in support of building a Ram Rajya, Modi told the rally.
""Terrorists in Pakistan have launched jihad against India. And here, the Congress party has announced a Vote Jihad against the BJP, and is asking its followers of a particular religion [Muslims] to unitedly vote against Modi.""
The Indian National Congress party is the main opposition party.
Delhi University professor of Hindi, Apoorvanand, who goes by one name, told VOA on Friday that, sensing a lack of enthusiasm among Hindu voters, Modi and other BJP leaders are ""desperate to energize them by feeding them the tried and tested anti-Muslim rhetoric.""
""The BJP has turned this election into a war between Hindus and Muslims,"" he said.
""His party is portraying it as the final opportunity for the Hindus to 'save' themselves from Muslims, by electing their ultimate savior to power  Modi.""
As India holds phased six-week-long elections continuing until June 1, Modi and some BJP leaders have been accused of delivering ""hate speeches"" during the campaign.
Wealth to infiltrators
Modi told a rally in the northwestern state of Rajasthan during the third week of April that if the Indian National Congress party came to power, it would distribute peoples wealth ""among those who are infiltrators and have more children,"" remarks widely believed to refer to Muslims.
Opposition parties and civil rights groups criticized Modi for the comments.
Amnesty India said that in his remarks Modi ""demonizes"" Indias Muslims and puts them at increased risk of human rights violations.
However, Modi did not stop targeting the opposition and Muslims. In the last week of April, in the western state of Gujarat, he said at another rally that the opposition Congress was helping Muslims in a plot to take over India.
""The opposition is asking Muslims to launch vote jihad. In the past, we heard about 'love jihad' and 'land jihad.' Be careful about this new jihad. You all know what jihads mean and against whom they are waged,"" Modi said.
Then came his remarks Tuesday in Madhya Pradesh, and two days later, Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah told a rally in the southern state of Telangana that a vote for Congress equaled a ""vote for jihad.""
""The 2024 general election is Narendra Modi versus [Congress leader] Rahul Gandhi, and this is a contest between [a] vote for development and [a] 'vote for jihad,'"" Shah said.
Modis latest Vote Jihad remark came after Maria Alam, a leader of the opposition Samajwadi Party, last month urged a Muslim gathering in Uttar Pradesh to go for ""jihad of votes,"" to oust BJP from power.
Alam told VOA that she had used the words ""jihad of votes"" but meant it in a different sense than Modi is implying.
""In Arabic, jihad means to struggle or exert strength and effort to accomplish a task. Using the words vote jihad in my speech, I urged people to strive together to accomplish the victory of secular forces,"" Alam said in Urdu.
""I was utterly shocked to find how the media and the ruling party leaders distorted the meaning of my words,"" she said.
In the last week of April, citizens and rights activists urged the Election Commission of India to act against the hate speech of Modi and other BJP leaders.
On Friday, the Congress party-led opposition wrote to the commission that it was allowing Modi to continue ""unchecked and brazen"" violations by not acting against him for his hate speech.
This was a ""complete abdication"" of the commission's duty, and the violations are being committed ""with impunity and utter disregard, the letter said.
BJP leaders divided
Modi has not reacted to accusations he is using hate speech on the campaign trail.
BJP party leaders are divided on this issue.
Two days after Modi said in Rajasthan that Congress would take peoples wealth and distribute it among ""infiltrators and those who have more children,"" his party spokesperson, Gaurav Bhatia, defended his remarks and said the prime minister had ""called a spade a spade.""
""Mr. Modis remarks have resonated with people,"" Bhatia said.
Some other BJP leaders seem to disagree with the anti-Muslim speeches of Modi and others.
New Delhi-based senior BJP leader Alok Vatsa told VOA that Modis speech, among others, has dropped to the ""lowest level possible.""
""The prime ministers speeches, especially those targeting the Muslim community, are completely unwarranted,"" Vatsa told VOA.
""Even those who have supported him blindly over the years, do not approve of his latest communal outbursts. In their eyes, it is unbecoming of someone of a prime ministers stature,"" he told VOA.
Anti-Muslim comments not unprecedented
Muslim leaders say Modis anti-Muslim comments are not unprecedented, as he has been long known for his ""intense hatred"" for Muslims.
Zafarul-Islam Khan, former chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, told VOA that after the 2002 Gujarat Riots, Modi refused to help displaced Muslims and dubbed their camps ""children-producing factories.""
""Under his watch, Gujarat witnessed mass marginalization, ghettoization and pauperization of Muslims.
""It was hoped that after becoming prime minister in 2014, Mr. Modi would behave like a statesman, but he and his ministers never let go any opportunity to vilify, harm and marginalize Muslims, to this day,"" he said.
Aakar Patel, chairman of the board of Amnesty International in India, said Modis anti-Muslim speeches are unbecoming of a prime minister.
""Mr. Modi is persistent with his hate speech which is likely to extend and intensify the systematic and systemic discrimination suffered by Indian Muslims,"" Patel told VOA.
Reacting to Modis reference to Muslim votes as ""Vote Jihad,"" Somdeep Sen, a professor of international development studies at Roskilde University in Denmark, told VOA that this is ""a usual narrative trope"" employed widely by Hindu nationalists.
""Islamophobia is at the very core of the Hindutva political project [aimed at making India a Hindu state] wherein the terrorism discourse is frequently weaponized to delegitimize critics and opposition parties. So, it makes sense that the political leader of this project  namely, Narendra Modi  has chosen to brandish this discourse in his political speeches during the election campaign,"" Sen said.
""At the polls, this divisive strategy could help tip the scales in favor of BJP in the Hindu majority nation,"" he said.

India voted on Monday in the fourth phase of a seven-week long general election, as campaign rhetoric became more strident over economic disparities and religious divisions.
The world's most populous nation began voting on April 19 in a seven-phase election in which nearly one billion people are eligible to vote, with ballots set to be counted on June 4.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a rare, third straight term in a vote which pits his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against an alliance of more than two dozen opposition parties, including main rival Congress.
""I appeal to all to vote for a decisive government,"" said Amit Shah, Modi's powerful aide and the country's interior affairs minister, as voting began.
Polling will be held for 96 seats in 10 states and territories on Monday, with 177 million people eligible to cast their ballots. A large number of seats are in the southern and eastern states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha where the BJP is not as strong as other parts of the country.
Turnout is being closely watched as marginally lower numbers in the first three phases has raised concerns about voter disinterest in an election without a strong, central issue. The impact of hot weather on voting is also being watched with maximums in many parts of the country around 40 degrees Celsius or higher.
The lower turnout has raised doubts over whether BJP and its allies can win the landslide predicted by opinion polls.
Analysts say the lower turnout prompted Modi to change the tack of his campaign after the first phase, shifting focus from his economic record to accusing the Congress of planning to extend welfare benefits to minority Muslims at the expense of disadvantaged tribal groups and Hindu castes.
Congress has denied making any such promise and has said Modi is rattled by the turnout, which the BJP denies.
About 80% of India's 1.4 billion people are Hindus but it also has the world's third largest Muslim population of about 200 million people. Surveys suggest voters are most concerned about unemployment and price rise.
Led by Rahul Gandhi, Congress is pitching for better representation and welfare programs for India's poor and disadvantaged groups, stating that wealth inequality has worsened during Modi's 10-year term, a charge rejected by the government.
The opposition INDIA alliance led by Congress got a shot in the arm ahead of Monday's vote when the Supreme Court gave temporary bail to Arvind Kejriwal, chief minister of the national capital territory of Delhi and a key opposition leader, allowing him to campaign.
Kejriwal is a fierce critic of Modi and was arrested a month before the elections in a liquor policy graft case, sparking accusations Modi's government was seeking to cripple the opposition through investigations and arrests.
Kejriwal denies the corruption allegations while the government says it does not influence law enforcement agencies.

religions should have nothing to do with politics, never!
The lower turnout has raised doubts over whether BJP and its allies can win the landslide predicted by opinion polls.
BJP will not even be able to get the 37  percentage vote that they got in 2019. There goes their agenda of amending the constitution.
They will win but with lesser number of seats because the opposition is much more united this time. Too bad the opposition lacks credibility, otherwise those who are not voting this time around might actually have voted for them.
@Wasabi If religion had nothing to do with politics then Islamophobia would still exist in India. Look at the South Asian diaspora in Europe to see the consequences of losing the religious morality but keeping the Islamophobic conflict.
The BJP is still likely to win and make some momentous gains including intervention into Tamil politics, something unheard of even ten years ago. They are likely to score Coimbatore which is the heart of Tamil Hindu Nationalism. Pondicherry is already a BJP seat.
religions should have nothing to do with politics, never!
In an ideal world, but the reality is that religion heavily feeds into politics and law. We have seen that recently with anti-abortion legislation in the USA and laws and ensuing debates about the hijab in Europe, particularly in France.
Modi is bad news for Muslims.

Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi said a country shouldnt be run on the basis of one person alone when questioned about whether he would contest elections in 2029.
Speaking to Times Now in a wide-ranging interview, Modi, 73 said it was hard to predict what would happen in politics and no country should run on one man. Modi has not specifically ruled out running for a fourth term if he wins this time though his Bharatiya Janata Party has an informal age limit of 75 for candidates seeking public office.
I dont want this country to run on Modi, he said. This Modi himself will not want.
With Modi widely expected to win a third five-year term in elections that conclude next month, there has been public discussion on how many terms he will ultimately contest. Hes the driving force behind the popularity of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which expects to win a bigger majority in parliament this year than it did in 2019.
In the interview, Modi accused foreign powers of attempting to influence Indias elections without saying who they were. He said they wouldnt succeed.
There is an attempt by some in the world to influence our elections, he said. They are not just giving their opinions but are trying to influence our polls. But they will not be successful.
Modi choked up with emotion while speaking about his late mother, the prime minister defended himself against critics who say his policies are authoritarian and anti-Muslim. He deflected criticism to the Indian National Congress, the main opposition group, who he said implemented dictatorial policies under leaders like Indira Gandhi.
Assuming a BJP victory, Modi would be the countrys first prime minister to serve three consecutive terms since Jawaharlal Nehru, who ruled India for nearly 17 years following its 1947 independence.
In March, Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah said the government had a strong record under Modi and predicted the prime minister would serve for another decade.
I can tell you that for the next 10 years, it will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi only, he said.

Without this, we risk our enormous demographic dividend going waste. Besides, we should not have farmers toiling in the sun as the planet heats up.

     
      How do INDIA and BJP propose to kick-start that transformation? This is unclear from their manifestos, speeches and interviews. The campaign has generated noise on redistribution of wealth. In any country, it is legit to question how the competing claims of various interest groups on the distribution of gains from economic growth would be settled. It would help if INDIAs Rahul Gandhi and the BJPs Prime Minister Narendra Modi tell us what according to them is the best way to sort out distributional conflicts and handle inevitable trade-offs.

     
      Gandhi ought to explain INDIAs policy position on the Congress manifesto promise of legal minimum support prices (MSPs) for farm produce. A similar proposal for law-backed MSPs, agriculture economist Ashok Gulati said, was rejected by Manmohan Singh of the Congress when he was PM. Gulati was chairman the official body that recommends MSP hikes during Singhs tenure.

Increased welfare spending and laabharthi economics havent quite fired consumption spending. Wages are not growing. Labours bargaining power is not improving.

     
      The government cut corporate tax rates and is making its capex sweat. But private investment remains sluggish. Economists at a conference on Indias economic growth at the Indian Statistical Institute last month debated if the fiscal multiplier is working at all. Has the relationship between public and private investment snapped?

     
      The fiscal stimulus administered by the Congress-led UPA government to help the economy recoup from the shock of a global crisis had sent the deficit rising. It was almost 6.5% of GDP in 2009-10 at its peak, after which the UPA reduced it by cutting spending and sacrificing GDP growth in the process. It bequeathed a fiscal deficit of almost 4.5% of GDP to the BJP government in 2014.

     
      The Modi government increased tax rates on fuels, which helped reduce the deficit to about 3.4% by 2018-19. However, the deficit started going up again, rising as high as 9.17% of GDP in covid year 2020-21 as lockdowns reduced tax collections. In April 2024, on the eve of elections, it was 5.8%, according to the 1 February budgets estimate.

     
      Even before the pandemic wrecked government finances, the government had already invoked the escape clause of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act to take leeway in the fiscal deficit for 2019-20. No other government has ever invoked this clause.

     
      Given the implications for inter- generational equity, inflation and GDP growth, what does the PM think can be done to resolve Indias chronic fiscal stress problem?

     
      The Congress promise of  ?1 lakh per year cash transfers to a woman in every poor household may be one way of nudging the economic growth engine of private consumption. But Gandhi should explain what data-base would be used to identify beneficiaries and avoid leaks, and if he has a plan to mitigate the increased risk of populism;  ?1 lakh a year may be hiked ahead of every election season. It would also help to know if fiscal stress worries his party.

Technology and policy in India
The Election Commission of India (ECI) on May 7 directed X, formerly Twitter, to take down an objectionable animated video shared by the Karnataka BJP handle. X was previously asked to take down the video by the Cyber Crime Division of Bengaluru Police on May 5 after an FIR was filed. On observing no action, the ECI wrote to Twitters assigned nodal officer .
The video was shared on May 4 during the Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka that ended on May 7. It depicted a caricature of Rahul Gandhi and implied his favoring Muslim voters.
In its letter to X, the ECI stated that the post was violative of the extant legal framework. The letter from the Cyber Crime Division detailed that the video violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) enforced during the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 and Section 123 (3) of the Representation of the People Act, (RP Act),1951. MCC warns parties against promoting feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of the citizens of India on grounds of religion, race, caste, community, or language and the RP Act deems causing tension between different castes and communities, religious or linguistic, a corrupt practice.

 Arvind Gunasekar (@arvindgunasekar) May 7, 2024


The ECI asked X to take down the video as per Section 79(3)(b) of Information Technology Act,2000 that makes a social media intermediary like X liable, if it fails to expeditiously remove or disable access to remove a post that is deemed by a Government agency. It also invoked rule 3(1)(d) of The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 which mandates that social media platforms must not host any content that is deemed as incitement to an offence relating to matters of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, public order and decency or morality by a Government agency.
In the past, X has disagreed with ECIs takedown orders. Particularly, it opposed the ECIs order to takedown certain posts containing political speech shared by elected politicians, political parties and candidates. X stated in an article:
In compliance with the orders, we have withheld these posts for the remainder of the election period; however, we disagree with these actions and maintain that freedom of expression should extend to these posts and political speech in general
X also shared the takedown orders publicly and called for transparency by the ECI regarding such actions.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'Globalsecurity.org'}",John Pike,"Religious polarization, jobs trouble India's young voters, but Modi has support","As India holds a phased election, Pavni Mishra, an undergraduate student at Delhi University, would prefer to watch the country's leaders focus on issues relevant to young voters like her, but she fears those issues are getting lost in the din of a polarized ",https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/india/2024/india-240516-voa01.htm,,2024-05-16T08:14:58Z,"By Anjana Pasricha May 16, 2024
As India holds a phased election, Pavni Mishra, an undergraduate student at Delhi University, would prefer to watch the country's leaders focus on issues relevant to young voters like her, but she fears those issues are getting lost in the din of a polarized campaign.
""We should have a healthy competition in our politics rather than talking about religion,"" said Mishra. ""We should talk about education, we should talk about employment, about how to empower our women and enlarge the startups in the country.""
At the start of his election campaign last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke of his vision of making India a developed country by 2047 and of welfare programs during his decade in power that had helped poor people.
But at his election rallies in recent weeks, the Hindu nationalist leader has accused the Congress Party of plans to give more benefits to Muslims if voted to power and warned women that the opposition would confiscate their gold and redistribute it to India's largest minority. The divisive rhetoric is seen as a bid to galvanize support in the Hindu majority country as he seeks a third term in office.
Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party is facing off with an alliance of opposition parties that includes the Congress Party, whose leader Rahul Gandhi is seen as the prime minister's main rival.
Modi has denied criticism that he is stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win. Gandhi has denied Modi's charges of plans to favor Muslims, who make up India's largest minority group.
India's 18 million first-time voters in the general elections include millions of undergraduate students. For many of them, the top issue is how the next government will create more employment opportunities in a country where despite a growing economy, finding suitable jobs for graduates has become a key challenge.
""I want a fair government that ensures employment for everyone,"" said 19-year-old Shreyas Sood. Another student, who did not want to be named, said even finding an internship was a challenge. ""I think the concern is about getting jobs which pay you a good decent amount to live. Everyone is stressed,"" she said.
They have reason to worry. According to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund, the unemployment rate for graduates is 29.1% -- nine times higher than for the lesser educated.
Despite such concerns, Modi's image as a strong leader who delivers results and has improved India's image overseas has won him the support of many young students.
""You can trust on Modi. I feel the country is in safe hands with him,"" said B. Prerna, an undergraduate student. Several students echoed that sentiment.
A survey among first-time voters by Lokniti research institute and the Center for Developing Societies indicated that Modi was the first choice for many who felt he could address youth-related challenges such as creating employment opportunities. Two-thirds of those surveyed said they would vote for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party and that Modi was best suited to lead the national government.
""In younger people, there is a natural tendency to veer towards someone who is very visible, strong, seen as an iconic figure, and as someone trying to deliver results. In that sense Modi ticks off most of the boxes,"" according to political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.
Some students say a weak opposition has limited their choices. Congress Party leader Rahul Gandhi has flagged the issue of employment in his campaign rallies, promised internships to college students and says his party will take steps to address growing economic inequality in the country.
But many perceive the Congress Party, which has been dislodged by the BJP as India's dominant party in the last decade, as an ailing party that has not rejuvenated itself.
""We have to vote for the Modi government because currently he is the only one who is looking good, who has a good face,"" said college student Satvik Sharma. ""To be honest, opposition in the country right now is very weak.""
Analysts say many young voters do not see any alternative to Modi. ""The opposition is fragmented and although several parties have strong leaders, they are not pan-Indian leaders. Rahul Gandhi is not a prime ministerial candidate,"" pointed out Kidwai.
However, students like Sharma worry about divisive rhetoric and growing polarization during the BJP's decade-long stint in power. ""The country and the youth are becoming religiously too radical, be it any religion,"" he said. ""I want the government to be a little liberal, the youth to be a little liberal and think about the country as a whole and not their religion as supreme.""
The use of issues such as caste and religion by political parties, has disillusioned some students in the world's youngest country - more than half of India is under 25.
""We are still fighting about mythical creatures and gods and religions. Rather, we should rather focus on the development of the country,"" said Amaldev K. He could not travel to his home state, Kerala, to cast his ballot, but he said that had he voted, he would have chosen an option that India allows on the ballot - NOTA or ""None of the Above"" which indicates a voter's dissatisfaction with all the candidates in the fray.

Earlier in the poll rally at Odisha's Berhampur, PM Modi attacked the BJD-ruled government over a range of issues and claimed the Naveen Patnaik-led government would expire on June 4, when Lok Sabha and Odisha assembly results will be declared.   Notably, in Odisha, simultaneous elections are being held for both assembly and Lok Sabha.   The Prime Minister arrived in Bhubaneswar on Sunday night for the election campaign. He will hold public rallies in Brahmapur and Nowrangpur today. On Sunday, BJP national president JP Nadda also arrived in Odisha. He released the party's manifesto for the Odisha assembly elections 2024 and vowed to end the corruption of Biju Janata Dal (BJD).   After Odisha, PM Modi will head to Andhra Pradesh to address two NDA election meetings, featuring alliance partners N Chandrababu Naidu from the TDP and Janasena chief Pawan Kalyan. The first meeting is scheduled in the afternoon at Vemagiri in Rajamahendravaram, East Godavari district, followed by another one later in the day at Anakapalli.   In the north, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi is expected to lead the Lok Sabha poll campaign in Rae Bareli and Amethi, and camp in these parliamentary constituencies in Uttar Pradesh from Monday to ensure the party's victory in the two high-profile seats. The Amethi and Rae Bareli seats will go to polls on May 20 in the fifth of the seven-phase general election.

A 56-second clip featuring Congress leader Rahul Gandhi addressing a pre-election rally before the fifth phase of Lok Sabha elections on May 20 is being widely circulated on social media. In the viral clip, Mr Gandhi was heard saying that ""when the election results are announced on June 4, 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will continue to hold office as the Prime Minister of India.""
""Today's breaking news: Congress' prominent leader Rahul Gandhi has made a significant prediction in a packed gathering about the upcoming June 4 You can listen to it yourself. If they come, it will be Modi,"" read the caption in Hindi.
Here's the link to the above post (archive).
NewsMobile fact check reveals that the viral video clip is digitally altered. 
After carefully analysing the viral clip, the NM team found discrepancies in the video such as unmatched lip sync, lack of continuity and unusual pauses in Rahul Gandhi's speech. 

Searching further, we found the original video uploaded on the official YouTube channel of the Indian National Congress (INC), dated May 10, 2024. It is from Kanpur INDIA bloc joint election rallies of Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Kannauj and Kanpur held on May 10 before the fourth phase on May 13 around Kanpur-Bundelkhand region.

The original version of the viral clip can be seen at the timestamp 01.00 in the video where Rahul Gandhi says: ""Let me tell you something that mainstream media will never tell you. Narendra Modi will not sustain his position as the Prime Minister of India on June 4, 2024. Keep this in writing.""He says: ""Narendra Modi ji will not be elected as the Prime Minister.""
We found a comparison video tweeted on the official X handle of the Congress party, dated May 15, 2024, suggesting a comparative analysis between the manipulated video and original one. 
The captain along with the tweet reads: ""The sinking BJP and Narendra Modi's fake news factory now have to rely only on fake videos. As per his habit, he edited Rahul Gandhi's speech and made a fake video and was then caught red-handed. You can see it yourself.""

The election is considered one of the most consequential in Indias history. If Modi wins, hell be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the countrys first prime minister.
The seventh round of voting in 57 constituencies across seven states and one union territory will complete polling for all 543 seats in the powerful lower house of parliament. Nearly 970 million voters  more than 10% of the worlds population  were eligible to elect a new parliament for five years. More than 8,300 candidates ran for the office.

Most polls show Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party leading over the broad opposition alliance thats challenging them, led by the Congress party. The votes will be counted Tuesday, with results expected by the end of the day.
Modis campaign, vying for a third-straight term, began on a platform of economic progress. He has promised to uplift the poor and turn India into a developed nation by 2047. But the campaign has turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as he escalated polarizing rhetoric in back-to-back incendiary speeches that targeted the countrys Muslim minority, who make up 14% of Indias 1.4 billion people.
After ending campaigning on Thursday, Modi went to meditate at a memorial site honoring a famous Hindu saint who is believed to have attained enlightenment there.
When the election kicked off in April, Modi and his BJP were widely expected to clinch another term.
Since first coming to power in 2014, Modi has enjoyed immense popularity. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved Indias standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the worlds fifth-largest.

At the same time, his rule has seen brazen attacks and hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims. Indias democracy, his critics say, is faltering and Modi has increasingly blurred the line between religion and state.
But as the campaign ground on, his party has faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics and are hoping to benefit from growing economic discontent.
Pre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefitted despite brisk economic growth under Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated.
In Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, voters lined up outside polling stations early Saturday morning to avoid the scorching heat, with temperatures expected to reach 34 degrees Celsius (93.2 Fahrenheit). Modi is challenged there by the states chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who heads the regional Trinamool Congress party.
There is a crunch for jobs now in the present market. I will vote for the government that can uplift jobs. And I hope those who cannot get jobs, they will get jobs, said Ankit Samaddar.
In this election, Modis BJP  which controls much of Indias Hindi-speaking northern and central parts  sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the countrys eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.

The BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80% of the population, after Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.
Instead, Modi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls.
This was seen as a tactic to energize his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the lack of any big-ticket national issue to help Modi propel his BJP to electoral victory, as he has done previously.
In 2014, Modis status as a political outsider cracking down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls on a wave of nationalism after his government launched airstrikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.
But things are different this time, analysts say, giving Modis political challengers a potential boost.
The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy. This election, people are voting keeping various issues in mind, said Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'Globalsecurity.org'}",John Pike,US watchdog documents hundreds of India election rallies targeting Muslims,Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stirred controversy with his anti-Muslim remarks since Indians began casting ballots in the country's parliamentary elections last month.,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/india/2024/india-240521-voa02.htm,,2024-05-22T09:13:09Z,"By Masood Farivar May 21, 2024
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stirred controversy with his anti-Muslim remarks since Indians began casting ballots in the country's parliamentary elections last month.
But it's not just Modi trafficking in controversial rhetoric about Muslims; top members of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been echoing similar sentiment as the party seeks a historic third term in power.
In the four weeks since the polls opened on April 19, Hindutva Watch, a U.S.-based watchdog, has documented hundreds of campaign rallies featuring the BJP's ""star campaigners"" and candidates delivering incendiary speeches targeting Muslims.
Hindutva Watch founder Raqib Hameed Naik said that in addition to Modi, the party's list of prominent campaigners includes Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah, Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, BJP National President Jagat Prakash Nadda and the chief ministers of several large states. Hindutva refers to the BJP's Hindu nationalist ideology.
""They're the ones at the core of the entire thing,"" Naik said in an interview with VOA.
Largest election in world
India's six-week election, considered the largest of its kind in the world, pits the BJP against a broad coalition of opposition parties. Voting runs until June 1, and the results will be announced on June 4.
Modi sparked a firestorm on April 21 when he warned supporters that if the opposition Indian National Congress came to power, it would redistribute India's wealth among ""infiltrators"" and ""those who have more children.""
The word ""infiltrator,"" once used for Bengali refugees, is often employed by right-wing Hindu nationalists to label all of India's 200 million Muslims as outsiders. Muslims are sometimes called ""child breeders,"" a baseless stereotype used to fan demographic fears.
Understood in this context, Modi's comments were panned by opposition parties and civil rights groups. But in the weeks since, they've been picked up and echoed by other BJP politicians in what experts call the ""elite effect.""
Naik, an exiled Kashmiri Muslim journalist, founded Hindutva Watch in 2021. In the years since, it has emerged as a respected repository of hate speech and hate crime in India, its work cited by mainstream news outlets.
Though Hindutva has documented nearly 3,000 instances of hate speech and hate crime, Naik said the election-related vitriol seen this year is without precedent.
""I have never seen this kind of inflammatory, hateful election campaign at the national level targeting Muslim minorities,"" Naik said.
Spokespeople for the BJP in New Delhi and the Indian Embassy in Washington did not respond to repeated email requests for comment. VOA has reached out to the BJP's U.S. lobbying arm for comment.
Last week, Modi sought to address the controversy over his ""infiltrators"" remark. Speaking with a local broadcaster, he denied saying ""Muslims have more children.""
""I won't do Hindu Muslim,"" he told News18. ""This is my pledge.""
To critics, the pledge rang hollow. The day he disavowed playing the Hindu-Muslim card, Modi warned supporters in the eastern state of Jharkhand, ""Infiltrators with jihadi mindset are getting support from [the] opposition and putting our sisters in danger.""
In the days since, Hindutva Watch has documented at least 10 rallies where Modi has by turn warned voters about alleged plans by Congress to redistribute national wealth among Muslims, award minority quotas to them and shut down a revered Hindu temple built on his watch.
Not all anti-Muslim statements documented by Hindutva Watch amount to hate speech, which is not a crime in India. Some are classified as inflammatory, dangerous or communal.
What Indians call ""communalism"" has long colored the contentious electoral politics of India, a country of 1.4 billion people, eight major religions and 22 official languages.
In 1984, the Congress Party, now in opposition, swept the polls, riding a wave of anti-Sikh furor created by the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.
Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said anti-Muslim rhetoric is ""part and parcel"" of the BJP's voter mobilization strategy. 
Founded in 1980 and in power since 2014, the BJP has long pursued two core objectives, Vaishnav said: improving the economic lot of the poor and creating a Hindu state.
""I don't think that this rhetoric we've seen on the campaign [trail] particularly surprises me, because it is in a sense attached to every BJP campaign,"" Vaishnav said.
As far back as 2002 when he served as Gujarat's chief minister, Modi didn't shy away from inflammatory rhetoric during violent Hindu-Muslim riots, Vaishnav said. More recently, the country's 2019 elections witnessed a surge in anti-Muslim rhetoric, he added.
""In a sense, [the current rhetoric] is unprecedented in part because of the way this gets magnified. But this kind of mobilization is certainly not new,"" he said.
'Love jihad,' 'land jihad,' 'vote jihad'
To mobilize voters, BJP candidates, along with other proponents of right-wing Hindu nationalists, have made frequent use of well-worn tropes and conspiracy theories about Muslims.
One is known as ""land jihad,"" a conspiracy theory that alleges Muslims are taking over public lands with unauthorized religious buildings. Another, called ""love jihad,"" accuses Muslim men of marrying Hindu women to convert them, with the ultimate goal of transforming India into a Muslim country. Hindutva Watch has recorded dozens of instances of both conspiracy theories during the campaign.
Earlier this month, a new variant of the phrase emerged: ""vote jihad."" After a local opposition leader called on Muslims to carry out a ""jihad"" of ""votes"" to oust Modi from power, the prime minister accused the Congress Party of announcing a ""vote jihad"" against the BJP.
""I hope you all know what the meaning of jihad is and against whom it is waged,"" Modi said.
The topic of jihad has routinely surfaced in campaign rallies. In a May 15 speech, independent candidate Sanjay Sharma warned supporters that ""this jihadi mentality will keep spreading"" if they ""don't wake up now.""
""Vote for me if you want to stop cow slaughter completely,"" Sharma said, according to a translation provided by Hindutva Watch. ""Vote for me if you want to stop love jihad.""
'Fear speech'
In a way, much of the rhetoric employed by BJP candidates is typical political strategy: politicians firing up supporters with exaggerated claims and fear-mongering.
""Look at what House and Senate candidates are saying on the campaign trail,"" Vaishnav said. ""Look at what Republican social media influencers are tweeting about.""
Rutgers University Professor Kiran Garimella described the campaign rhetoric suggesting a Muslim takeover through population growth as ""fear speech,"" a term used by researchers.
""We see a lot of cases where this kind of rhetoric is being used both in India and in the U.S.,"" Garimella said.
But it's not just rhetoric that's worrisome, said veteran Indian journalist and civil rights activist Ajit Sahi.
""In India, the rhetoric is part of a larger movement, which is organized, financed and has boots on the ground,"" said Sahi, now advocacy director for the Indian American Muslim Council. ""If there was just rhetoric, that would be possibly tolerable, but the rhetoric is combined with an organized and deeply financed and widely penetrated movement.""

This victory of BJP for the third time is the result of the tireless hard work of our workers. For this victory, I congratulate the National President of BJP Mr. JP Nadda ji and all the BJP workers working hard in every part of the country. For BJP, its workers are its biggest asset.

Defying all exit-poll predictions, the TMC raced ahead in 29 of West Bengals 42 Lok Sabha seats, surprising political pundits, while the BJP struggled to reach double digits, leading in only 12 seats, and Congress won just one seat, according to the EC website.
If TMCs leads translate into results, the party is set for its second-best performance in the state, following its 2014 victory when it won 34 seats.
As of 6 pm, the TMC had secured 46 per cent of the votes, up from 43 per cent in 2019.
In the last Lok Sabha polls, the TMC won 22 seats, the BJP 18, and the Congress two. Despite a vigorous campaign led by top BJP leaders, the party is poised to see a decline of seven seats, and a 2 per cent drop in vote share, having received 40 per cent of the votes in 2019.

BY Raghavendra with a margin of 243715, JDS Kumaraswamy with a margin of 284620 votes, and Mallesh Babu with a margin of 71388 voters.
From a brutal majority to a virtual battle for survival. YS Jagan Mohan Reddys electoral fortunes seem to have plummeted to unexpected depths within a span of five years, during which the outgoing Chief Minister launched a slew of populist measures.
Having floated his YSRCP in 2011 following the death of his father and charismatic late Chief Minister of the undivided Andhra Pradesh, YS Rajasekhar Reddy, Reddy had to wait for another eight years before getting into the ruling saddle.
We went to the Election Commission at short notice to convey a concern of ours. The main issue was about not updating parliamentary constituency data round by round in terms of votes counted and the results of that round. However, it was clarified that it is done Assembly segment-wise. Parliamentary constituencies have on average seven Assemblies and it is done each round in each Assembly segment. Different Assembly segments follow different speeds of counting and also updation which is why there is a lack of synchronism in parliamentary constituency on the whole.

In an exclusive interview with NDTV, Mr Kharge said that the Congress is hoping to win 128 seats in the Lok Sabha elections.
""From the reports we have received, we are sure that we will stop BJP from coming back to power. We believe that Congress has already crossed the 100-seat mark and are hoping to win 128 seats,"" Mr Kharge told NDTV.
Several Opposition parties joined hands ahead of the elections to defeat BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Speaking about the performance of the INDIA alliance, Mr Kharge said, ""We (INDIA alliance) have performed very well together. We also tried to help each other during the polls, which resulted in our votes getting transferred to each other.""

Voting for the 543 seats of Lok Sabha began on April 19, and the last and seventh leg will be held on June 1. Results will be declared on June 4, and a party needs to cross the 272 mark to form the government.
Mr Kharge has called for a meeting of all alliance members where he plans to discuss how to identify if Electronic Voting Machines are being tampered with during the counting of votes.
""To ensure that there is no meddling during the counting of votes, we have called for a meeting on June 1. We will tell every leader how EVM tampering works and how to ensure it doesn't happen,"" Mr Kharge said.

Early trends updated at 10:30 am showed that the BJP-led NDA was leading even as the Opposition's INDIA bloc gained momentum. According to Times Now, NDA at 10:30 am was leading with 296 seats while the INDIA bloc had 217 seats.
According to early trends on the Election Commission's website, Rahul Gandhi was leading as of 10:30 am and had 80203 more votes than CPI(M)'s Annie Raja, his closest rivalm in Kerala's Wayanad. In Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareli, a Congress bastion from where Rahul is contesting for the first time, the leader is leading by 40149 against his closest rival - BJP's Dinesh Pratap Singh.
Earlier during the elections, Rahul Gandhi had filed nominations from two seats - Kerala's Wayanad and Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareli. While Wayanad has been Rahul Gandhi's bastion for years, this is the first time he contested from Rae Bareli. Rahul did not contest from Amethi, and instead chose Rae Bareli - a Congress stronghold vacated by his mother Sonia Gandhi, who recently took oath as a Rajya Sabha MP. But can Rahul Gandhi contest from two seats simultaneously? According to the Representation of the People Act, 1951, a candidate can legally contest from two Lok Sabha seats at the same time.
Early trends show Rahul Gandhi leading from both Wayanad and Rae Bareli with decent margins. Even though Rahul is legally eligible to contest from both the seats, he cannot represent both the Lok Sabha constituencies in the Parliament at the same time. Under Sec 33(7) of RPA, 1951, if a person is elected from both the constituencies, he has to resign from one of them within 14 days of the results, failing which both the seats will fall vacant. This will trigger a by-election in the vacated constituency.
Historically, prominent politicians have contested from dual Lok Sabha seats. During the 1996 general elections, former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee contested from Gandhinagar and Lucknow, and won both the seats. He chose to retain Lucknow. Sonia Gandhi in 2009 fought from Bellari in Karnataka and Amethi in Uttar Pradesh. In 2019, Narendra Modi fought from Gujarat's Vadodara and Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi. He won from both and retained the Varanasi seat.Also Read: Lok Sabha Election Results: How are votes counted? How long does it take to count votes?

Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi voted today as the country's six-week election resumed, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rivals accusing his government of unjustly targeting them in criminal probes.
PM Modi, 73, remains roundly popular after a decade in office and his ruling BJP is widely expected to win a third term next month after a poll hit by recurrent early summer heatwaves.
His prospects have been further bolstered by several criminal investigations into his opponents, sparking concerns from UN rights chief Volker Turk.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi cast his ballot at a polling station in Delhi, where temperatures were forecast to reach 43 degree Celsius.
A son, grandson, and great-grandson of former prime ministers, Rahul Gandhi paused after voting to take a selfie with his mother Sonia Gandhi, but did not speak to crowds of reporters.
The scion of a dynasty that dominated Indian politics for decades, he was convicted of criminal libel last year after a complaint by BJP leader.
His two-year prison sentence saw him disqualified from parliament until the verdict was suspended by the Supreme Court.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, 55, and chief of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), who was detained in March in a long-running graft case, also voted today.
The Supreme Court bailed Mr Kejriwal earlier this month, and he returned to the campaign trail. ""Modi has started a very dangerous mission,"" he said soon after his release. ""Modi will send all opposition leaders to jail,"" he said.
The Congress is spearheading an Opposition alliance of more than two dozen parties competing jointly against PM Modi, including the AAP.
Mr Kejriwal's organisation grew out of an anti-corruption movement a decade ago, and has been elected to office in Delhi and Punjab, but has struggled to establish itself as a nationwide force.
In February, the authorities froze several Congress bank accounts as part of a running dispute over income tax returns filed five years ago, a move the Gandhis said had severely impacted the party's ability to contest the election.
""We have no money to campaign, we cannot support our candidates,"" Rahul Gandhi told reporters in March.
Heatwave 'Red Alert'
India is voting in seven phases over six weeks to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country.
Turnout is down several percentage points from the last national poll in 2019, with analysts blaming widespread expectations of a PM Modi victory as well as hotter-than-average temperatures heading into the summer.
India's weather bureau this week issued a heatwave ""red alert"" for Delhi and surrounding states where tens of millions of people were casting their ballots on Saturday.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned of heightened health risks for infants, the elderly and those with chronic diseases.
Extensive scientific research shows climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense, with Asia warming faster than the global average.

Voting has ended in India's mammoth election with exit polls projecting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies will win a big majority in Parliament.
Voters cast ballots on Saturday for 57 Parliamentary constituencies in the seventh phase of the polls that stretched over six weeks in the searing summer heat.
All eyes are now on Tuesday, when votes will be counted for all 543 elected seats in the lower house of Parliament. As India uses electronic voting machines, results are expected the same day.
The elections will test the popularity of 73-year-old Modi whose image of a strong leader and champion of Hindu nationalism has been boosted by a host of welfare measures for tens of millions of poor people during his decade in power.
The BJP campaign was dominated by the Indian leader, who crisscrossed the country to hold over 200 rallies.
Before elections got under way, the BJP was expected to cruise to an easy victory. The party had set a target of winning a supermajority by bagging 400 seats.
According to exit polls broadcast by several television channels, the party along with its allies could win 350 seats or more, far ahead of the 272 needed for a simple majority. That would hand Modi a rare, third straight term in office.
""It's a litmus test for Mr. Modi. When elections started, it appeared to be a one-horse race. He appeared very invincible, very formidable and raised the bar very high,"" according to political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.
Many observers had expected an opposition alliance of over two dozen parties that is challenging Modi of cutting into his party's huge Parliamentary majority but exit polls projected that it would not be able to do so and showed the alliance trailing with around 150 seats. However, in the vast, diverse country, exit polls have not always been reliable.
""The final numbers will depend on whether the BJP can hold ground in populous northern states where the party has secured huge success in the past,"" analyst Kidwai said.
After polls closed on Saturday, Modi thanked voters and expressed confidence that the ""people of India have voted in record numbers"" to reelect the government.
His comments came after he ended two days of meditation at the southernmost tip of India at a memorial for Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda -- images released by his party showed him clad in saffron robes with eyes closed and prayer beads in hand.
The opposition's hopes of making gains rest on tapping into growing resentment over high unemployment that faces the country's huge youth population and rising prices.
Congress Party leader, Rahul Gandhi, who was the face of the opposition campaign, focused his campaign on the need to create jobs and growing wealth inequality in the country and said the government's policies have favored the rich at the expense of the poor. The party has promised cash transfers to poor women and a guarantee of apprenticeships for college graduates. It has also raised concerns about democratic backsliding under Modi.
The Congress Party has been marginalized over the last decade amid the BJP's rise into a formidable political force under Modi - it only holds 52 seats in Parliament.
""Much will depend on how the Congress Party and its allies perform in swing states like Maharashtra in the west, Bihar in the east and Karnataka in the south,"" according to Kidwai.
The opposition faces a daunting task. To make significant gains it would also have to fare well in populous northern states, where the BJP is well entrenched and where its Hindu nationalist agenda resonates the most. The BJP, on its part, hopes to expand its influence in some southern states where it has virtually no presence.
The election campaign has been called one of India's most divisive. At rallies, Modi charged the Congress Party of being pro-Muslim and of planning to hand benefits reserved for lower caste Hindus to Muslims if it is voted into power - analysts said the polarizing rhetoric was a bid to shore up support among his Hindu base after voting got off to a lackluster start last month.
In a letter on Thursday addressed to voters in Punjab, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accused Modi of indulging in the ""most vicious form of hate speeches that are purely divisive in nature"" during the campaign and accused him lowering the dignity of the Prime Minister's office.
Punjab was among the seven states and one federal territory that voted on Saturday.
Only India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, secured a third straight term in office. The winning party is expected to form the next government by mid-June before the term of the present Parliament ends.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday distanced himself from speculation he could become the next Prime Minister - if the Congress-led INDIA bloc wins the Lok Sabha election.
He also sidestepped questions about Rahul Gandhi as a prime ministerial candidate, saying no such discussion had taken place and that the INDIA bloc would take a decision after the election results.
Mr Kejriwal pointed out the AAP is a ""small party... contesting only 22 seats"" in this election; the comment has been seen as indicative that his chances of being PM, at this time, are remote.

Speaking to news agency PTI, hesaid, ""I don't have any intention of becoming the next PM if INDIA bloc wins."" The AAP leader - on bail after his arrest in the liquor policy case- said his aim is to save the nation from a ""dictatorship"", alleging opposition leaders will be jailed if the BJP comes back to power.
""The polls are for saving the country and democracy from prevailing dictatorship. They (referring to the BJP without naming the party) will finish democracy if they come back to power,"" Mr Kejriwal said.
This is not the first time Mr Kejriwal has had to answer the question of an INDIA PM face.
Last week, at a press conference in Lucknow, the AAP chief responded with a categorical ""No, I am not"" when asked if he is in the running to become PM in the event of an INDIA win.

The INDIA grouping - formed in June last year to unite the opposition and stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP from claiming a third term - is contesting sans a candidate for the top job. The BJP, on the other hand, continues to fight from behind Mr Modi's larger-than-life shadow.
The BJP has often mocked its rivals for not naming a PM candidate or even an alliance figurehead, which it has claimed underlines persistent rifts that reflect incompatible political ideologies.
NDTV Exclusive |Shah Mocks AAP Promises, Says ""They're Fighting 22 Seats""
Earlier today Home Minister Amit Shah - campaigning in Bengal's Ghatal - ripped into the opposition, declaring they had failed to name a candidate because they had no leader of that calibre. In a thinly-veiled swipe at the Congress, Mr Shah said his rivals only sought to extend their ""dynasty"".
The opposition ""does not have leaders or any intention to develop the country"" he raged, and repeated his attack from last week; at rallies in Bihar the union minister claimed the INDIA bloc ""doesn't have a PM face (and) have decided to rotate the PM's chair among themselves"".
""The INDI alliance doesn't have any leaders. The INDI alliance wants five PMs in five years. The INDI alliances neither have leaders nor have any intention for the development of the nation,"" he said.
The 'dynasty' jibe is a favoured BJP attack on the Congress and the Gandhi family. It was extended Tuesday by Mr Modi to Samajwadi Party boss and ex-Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge offered a similar answer as far back as November, telling NDTV his party was against projecting any one individual to be sucked into a head-to-head against Mr Modi.

Millions of Indians voted Saturday in the last phase of India's mammoth election that will decide whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi secures a third consecutive term in office.
Voters were casting ballots for 57 parliamentary constituencies in the seventh phase of the polls that stretched over six weeks in the searing summer heat.
Among the seats for which votes were cast on Saturday was Modi's constituency, Varanasi, a holy Hindu city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The Hindu nationalist leader has won the seat in the last two elections with huge margins.

The final phase is held as the country of 1.4 billion people is experiencing voter fatigue due to scorching summer temperatures and unusually high heatwaves.
More than 100 million people were registered to vote on Saturday to elect members for Lok Sabha or the lower house of parliament.
Modi's constituency in Varanasi, which is considered as the spiritual capital by the Hindu majority in India, is one of the constituencies  voting in the last phase.
The seven-phase vote, which began on April 19, has primarily revolved around the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under the leadership of Modi, and the main opposition Indian National Congress party.
Congress's Rahul Gandhi is the scion of the family which ruled India for over half a decade, who is giving Modi a tough competition. 
The opposition parties have formed the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), primarily led by the Congress party, to counter the BJP.
The main focus of the opposition campaign has been on affirmative action and protecting the constitution from what they call as Modi's dictatorship.
After coming to power for the first time in 2014, Modi's two-time tenure has faced criticism for rising unemployment, attacks on minorities, and depleting press freedom.
Nevertheless, Modi is widely expected to win a third term in office when results are announced Tuesday.
His image at home has been bolstered by India's rising diplomatic and economic clout. The country overtook Britain as the world's fifth-biggest economy in 2022.
He has already led the BJP to two landslide victories in 2014 and 2019, forged in large part by his appeal to the Hindu faithful.
Muslim concerns 
This year, he presided over the inauguration of a grand temple to the deity Ram, built on the grounds of a centuries-old mosque in Ayodhya razed by Hindu zealots in 1992.
The event and numerous appeals to India's majority Hindus over the past decade have made many among the country's 200 million-plus minority Muslim community increasingly uneasy about their futures.
Modi himself has made a number of strident comments about Muslims on the campaign trail, referring to them as ""infiltrators"".
He has also accused the coalition of more than two dozen opposition parties of plotting to redistribute India's wealth to its Muslim citizens.
Western countries have largely sidestepped concerns over rights and democratic freedoms in the hopes of cultivating an ally that can help counter China, India's northern neighbor and rival regional power.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'Globalsecurity.org'}",John Pike,Modi's anti-Muslim 'Vote Jihad' rhetoric faces severe criticism,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of amplifying divisive rhetoric during the country's election campaign by calling Muslim votes ""Vote Jihad"" to encourage Hindus to vote for his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is seeking a h",https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/india/2024/india-240512-voa01.htm,,2024-05-12T07:46:54Z,"By Shaikh Azizur Rahman May 12, 2024
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of amplifying divisive rhetoric during the country's election campaign by calling Muslim votes ""Vote Jihad"" to encourage Hindus to vote for his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is seeking a historic third term.
Modi told a BJP rally last Tuesday in the central Madhya Pradesh province that voters would have to carefully choose between ""Vote Jihad"" and ""Ram Rajya."" The term, meaning ""Ram's Governance,"" refers to an ideal society characterized by equality, prosperity and justice. In recent years, some have come to believe this ideal can only be achieved through the rise of the BJP.
""At this important turning point in history you have to decide whether you will allow Vote Jihad to continue or, vote in support of building a Ram Rajya,"" Modi told the rally.
""Terrorists in Pakistan have launched jihad against India. And here, the Congress party has announced a Vote Jihad against the BJP, and is asking its followers of a particular religion [Muslims] to unitedly vote against Modi.""
The Indian National Congress party is the main opposition party.
Delhi University professor of Hindi, Apoorvanand, who goes by one name, told VOA on Friday that, sensing a lack of enthusiasm among Hindu voters, Modi and other BJP leaders are ""desperate to energize them by feeding them the tried and tested anti-Muslim rhetoric.""
""The BJP has turned this election into a war between Hindus and Muslims,"" he said.
""His party is portraying it as the final opportunity for the Hindus to 'save' themselves from Muslims, by electing their ultimate savior to power — Modi.""
As India holds phased six-week-long elections continuing until June 1, Modi and some BJP leaders have been accused of delivering ""hate speeches"" during the campaign.
Wealth to 'infiltrators'
Modi told a rally in the northwestern state of Rajasthan during the third week of April that if the Indian National Congress party came to power, it would distribute people's wealth ""among those who are infiltrators and have more children,"" remarks widely believed to refer to Muslims.
Opposition parties and civil rights groups criticized Modi for the comments.
Amnesty India said that in his remarks Modi ""demonizes"" India's Muslims and puts them at increased risk of human rights violations.
However, Modi did not stop targeting the opposition and Muslims. In the last week of April, in the western state of Gujarat, he said at another rally that the opposition Congress was helping Muslims in a plot to take over India.
""The opposition is asking Muslims to launch vote jihad. In the past, we heard about 'love jihad' and 'land jihad.' Be careful about this new jihad. You all know what jihads mean and against whom they are waged,"" Modi said.
Then came his remarks Tuesday in Madhya Pradesh, and two days later, Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah told a rally in the southern state of Telangana that a vote for Congress equaled a ""vote for jihad.""
""The 2024 general election is Narendra Modi versus [Congress leader] Rahul Gandhi, and this is a contest between [a] vote for development and [a] 'vote for jihad,'"" Shah said.
Modi's latest Vote Jihad remark came after Maria Alam, a leader of the opposition Samajwadi Party, last month urged a Muslim gathering in Uttar Pradesh to go for ""jihad of votes,"" to oust BJP from power.
Alam told VOA that she had used the words ""jihad of votes"" but meant it in a different sense than Modi is implying.
""In Arabic, jihad means to struggle or exert strength and effort to accomplish a task. Using the words 'vote jihad' in my speech, I urged people to strive together to accomplish the victory of secular forces,"" Alam said in Urdu.
""I was utterly shocked to find how the media and the ruling party leaders distorted the meaning of my words,"" she said.
In the last week of April, citizens and rights activists urged the Election Commission of India to act against the hate speech of Modi and other BJP leaders.
On Friday, the Congress party-led opposition wrote to the commission that it was allowing Modi to continue ""unchecked and brazen"" violations by not acting against him for his hate speech.
This was a ""complete abdication"" of the commission's duty, and the violations are being committed ""with impunity and utter disregard,"" the letter said.
BJP leaders divided
Modi has not reacted to accusations he is using hate speech on the campaign trail.
BJP party leaders are divided on this issue.
Two days after Modi said in Rajasthan that Congress would take people's wealth and distribute it among ""infiltrators and those who have more children,"" his party spokesperson, Gaurav Bhatia, defended his remarks and said the prime minister had ""called a spade a spade.""
""Mr. Modi's remarks have resonated with people,"" Bhatia said.
Some other BJP leaders seem to disagree with the anti-Muslim speeches of Modi and others.
New Delhi-based senior BJP leader Alok Vatsa told VOA that Modi's speech, among others, has dropped to the ""lowest level possible.""
""The prime minister's speeches, especially those targeting the Muslim community, are completely unwarranted,"" Vatsa told VOA.
""Even those who have supported him blindly over the years, do not approve of his latest communal outbursts. In their eyes, it is unbecoming of someone of a prime minister's stature,"" he told VOA.
Anti-Muslim comments not unprecedented
Muslim leaders say Modi's anti-Muslim comments are not unprecedented, as he has been long known for his ""intense hatred"" for Muslims.
Zafarul-Islam Khan, former chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, told VOA that after the 2002 Gujarat Riots, Modi refused to help displaced Muslims and dubbed their camps ""children-producing factories.""
""Under his watch, Gujarat witnessed mass marginalization, ghettoization and pauperization of Muslims.
""It was hoped that after becoming prime minister in 2014, Mr. Modi would behave like a statesman, but he and his ministers never let go any opportunity to vilify, harm and marginalize Muslims, to this day,"" he said.
Aakar Patel, chairman of the board of Amnesty International in India, said Modi's anti-Muslim speeches are unbecoming of a prime minister.
""Mr. Modi is persistent with his hate speech which is likely to extend and intensify the systematic and systemic discrimination suffered by Indian Muslims,"" Patel told VOA.
Reacting to Modi's reference to Muslim votes as ""Vote Jihad,"" Somdeep Sen, a professor of international development studies at Roskilde University in Denmark, told VOA that this is ""a usual narrative trope"" employed widely by Hindu nationalists.
""Islamophobia is at the very core of the Hindutva political project [aimed at making India a Hindu state] wherein the terrorism discourse is frequently weaponized to delegitimize critics and opposition parties. So, it makes sense that the political leader of this project - namely, Narendra Modi - has chosen to brandish this discourse in his political speeches during the election campaign,"" Sen said.
""At the polls, this divisive strategy could help tip the scales in favor of BJP in the Hindu majority nation,"" he said.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'Livemint'}",Narayan Ramachandran,Could a few swing states determine who governs India?,A significant number of Lok Sabha constituencies across India could see very close results. Who will form a government is still an open question.,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/could-a-few-swing-states-determine-who-governs-india-11715019836004.html,https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/05/06/1600x900/2-0-878859322-evm1-0_1679631951972_1715022225440.JPG,2024-05-07T07:00:07Z,"
     
      India is in the midst of conducting its 18th Lok Sabha elections. In the first eight of these Parliamentary polls held after independence, the winning party had more than the required majority of seats to form a government, ranging from a high of 143 more for Rajiv Gandhi of the Congress in 1984 to a low of just 22 over the majority-mark for his predecessor Indira Gandhi in 1967. The reason to look at it this way is that the number of Lok Sabha seats has varied over time, from a low of 489 for the first elections held in 1951 to the current 543, so using a benchmark of the majoritys size allows direct comparison.

     
      From the ninth through the 15th general elections in 2009, the winning party was short of a majority, with the deficit ranging from 127 in the 2004 Congress victory for Manmohan Singh to 24 in the same partys 1991 win that saw P.V. Narasimha Rao become prime minister. Negative majority margins necessitate coalition governments. The pattern changed in the elections of 2014 and 2019, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 10 and 31 seats over majority- mark, respectively.

     
      Will the BJP or Congress maintain the trend of a single party returning more than the required majority to Parliament in 2024? It can only be either of these parties, as they are the only two contesting more than the majority number of 272 seats; BJP candidates have registered in 446 constituencies and Congress leaders in 327. Statistically speaking, the probability of the Congress achieving the halfway mark alone, with an 82% success rate required on contested seats, is very low. In terms of candidates, the third largest party at the moment is the Samajwadi Party (SP), with 62 constituencies. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has not yet announced its full list of candidates, as Indias multi-phase elections allow later declarations.

     
      There are various types of voting systems around the world, too numerous and too arcane to review here. Suffice it to say that they attempt to balance proportionality, voter choice and local representation. Like the UK, India uses a first-past-the-post system (FPTP). This term is a reference to horse racing, where the first horse to cross the post is the sole winner, whether it leads by just a nose or a whole mile. The candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins, even if the persons vote share is less than half the total votes cast, as often happens when there are more than two contestants in the fray.

     
      In the 2019 elections, BJP candidates in as many as 224 Parliamentary constituencies won with a voter share greater than 50%, implying that they would have won those seats under any electoral system. An excellent analysis on Print.in puts paid to the unexamined notion that those 224 seats came exclusively from BJP strongholds in five states, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, which together account for 200 Lok Sabha seats.

     
      Instead, it is less concentrated than expected in those states (except Gujarat) and reasonably well spread across other states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Haryana. In 2019, counter-intuitively, non-BJP parties secured over half the votes cast in 117 constituencies in states as diverse as Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, but also including Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, among others.

     
      One way to predict the outcome of these elections is to notionally award those 224 safe seats to the BJP and the 117 others to non-BJP parties (with some adjustments to be made for differences in who is with the BJP this time versus the last), with the remaining 202 constituencies counted as swing seats for analysis. But this could yield erroneous results for two reasons.

     
      One, the past is not necessarily prologue; and two, the nature (in a structural sense that matters to the FPTP system) of the BJPs opposition at the state level has changed. For instance, in Uttar Pradesh, the mahagatbandhan (grand coalition) between the SP and BSP of the last election has broken down since then, and the SP has allied itself with the Congress in the INDIA bloc, even as the BSP fades.

     
      In Bihar, Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (United) has been allocated 16 seats in the NDA bloc, and it is hard to tell what his constant flip-flops will imply for results. In Maharashtra, there are now two Shiv Senas and two Nationalist Congress Parties (NCPs). There is heated debate about whether citizens would prefer the original versions of these parties under Uddhav Thackery and Sharad Pawar, respectively, or the newer splinters that have been awarded the original party symbols.

     
      Even though each seat counts as one and it matters not from which state it comes, in the 17 states with more than 10 seats each (that together make up 502), six states count as swing states. These are Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Haryana. You could add Bihar to this list for 2024. These battle-ground states form a sort of cummerbund around Indias heartland.

     
      These arent swing states in the American sense, as the whole state isnt awarded to a sole winner, but because the FPTP winner in each constituency will likely be determined by a small margin and will be deeply influenced by the number of candidates, as well as local factors. There are a total of 152 seats in these six states (192 if you add Bihar). By my estimate, about half of these will be too close to call and will thus determine whether the recent trend of non-coalition governments is maintained or reversed.

     
      P.S. With the slightest pushin just the right placeit can be tipped,"" said Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point.

Terming the 2024 Lok Sabha polls as ""not an ordinary election"", Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday urged the voters to come out in large numbers.
In a post on X, Rahul said, ""Today is the third phase of voting! I request all of you to come out in large numbers and vote to protect your rights. Remember, this is not an ordinary election, it is an election to protect the democracy and constitution of the country.""

Earlier, Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge urged countrymen to come in large numbers and vote in the third phase of the ongoing Lok Sabha election and asked the people when they press the button on the EVM, to keep in mind that they are deciding not just their future but the collective future of 140 crore fellow Indians.
In a post on X, Kharge said that a correct decision now can create an India where ""Justice"" is supreme.

The Republican Party of India (Athawale) national president and Union Minister Ramdas Athawale on Monday wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, Rajiv Kumar, urging action against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for making ""false"" allegation that RSS and Prime Minister Narendra Modi want to abolish the Constitution to end the basic rights of Dalits and deprived sections of society.
Meanwhile, voting is underway for 93 Lok Sabha seats across 11 states and union territories in the third phase of the general election on Tuesday.
The states and union territories where the elections are being held in this phase are Assam (4), Bihar (5), Chhattisgarh (7), Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu (2), Goa (2), Gujarat (25), Karnataka (14), Maharashtra (11), Madhya Pradesh (8), Uttar Pradesh (10) and West Bengal (4).

""Hamara palda bahut bhari hai (The scales are tilted in our favour),"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi told NDTV in an exclusive interview, projecting confidence in his ability to secure a third straight term for his party, BJP, in the Lok Sabha elections.
Four rounds are over in the marathon six-week general election, the second biggest since the general election of 1951-52. Three more rounds remain. The votes will be counted on June 4. 
""Itna bada desh. Aap jisko (vote) dene jaa rahe ho, jaante ho kya, uska naam pata hai kya, uska anubhav pata hai kya. Toh ye desh ki janta dekhti hai. Koi party apne naam bataaye ya na bataaye woh tolti hai (It is such a big country. Do you know whom you want to give your vote to? Their name, their experience? The nation sees everything. Whether the party names the person or not, the voters assess them),"" PM Modi said in an interview with NDTV's Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Pugalia. 

""Aur hamara palda bahut bhari hai usme mujhe kuch kehne ki jaroorat nahi hai. Hamara palda bhaari hai, har koi jaanta hai (The scales are heavily tilted in our favour.

The Congress, attenuated by poll losses and a string of defections, is part of the Opposition bloc INDIA taking on the BJP.
The Prime Minister, who has tasked his ministers to come up with an action plan for the first 100 days of his new government, told NDTV the route to success - stressing on scope, scale, speed and skill.
""The scope should be very big, it shouldn't be in parts, and the second thing is scale, which should also be large. The speed should be in sync with these two. So, scope, scale and speed, and then there should be skill. If we can get these four things together, I believe, we achieve a lot,"" said the Prime Minister, who is contesting from Varanasi.
The BJP swept the politically prized state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends most number of MPs (80) to Lok Sabha, in 2014 and 2019, winning 71 and 62 seats, respectively.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'Globalsecurity.org'}",John Pike,Indian Kashmir voting reaches 59%,A voter turnout of 59% was reported Monday in Indian-administered Kashmir during the fifth phase of the Indian general elections. The May 20 polling marks significant progress for the area since the eruption of armed conflict in the region against Indian forc,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/india/2024/india-240521-voa01.htm,,2024-05-22T09:13:09Z,"By Muheet Ul Islam May 21, 2024
A voter turnout of 59% was reported Monday in Indian-administered Kashmir during the fifth phase of the Indian general elections. The May 20 polling marks significant progress for the area since the eruption of armed conflict in the region against Indian forces in 1989.
More than 1.7 million adults were eligible to vote in the disputed Himalayan territory of Jammu and Kashmir, a region claimed by both India and Pakistan.
Historically, the Kashmir valley has experienced low voter turnout in parliamentary elections. The highest turnout was recorded in 1984 at 61.09%. In 2019, some 37% of voters participated.
The elections in India began in late April and will continue through June. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third term in office. His bitter rival, Rahul Gandhi, is aiming to replace him.
""This year's poll percentage is definitely the second highest in the democratic history of Baramulla Parliamentary Constituency,"" reads a media statement issued from the office of Jammu and Kashmir's chief electoral officer, Pandurang Kondbarao Pole.
""The main reasons for the increased turnout include improved security and law-and-order conditions over the last 4-5 years, mobilization efforts by 22 candidates and political parties, election awareness initiatives by Deputy Commissioners and the CEO office through Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation activities, and, importantly, the voters' strong belief that it is the ballot which can lead to sustainable development,"" the statement added.
Polling for Baramulla, a northern constituency, started slowly but gained momentum in the latter half of the day. Voters of all ages were seen lining up to cast their ballots.
""Voting is a fundamental right that allows us to participate in the democratic process and honor those who fought for democracy and equal rights,"" Ruqaya Akhter, a first-time voter, told VOA. ""Many individuals and movements have faced significant challenges to secure this right for all citizens, often in the face of violence, discrimination and imprisonment. By voting, we acknowledge and respect the sacrifices made by those who risked their lives to ensure a fair and inclusive society for everyone.""
In Baramulla, the expected battle was between Omar Abdullah, the former chief minister and vice president of the National Conference, or NC, party, and Sajad Ghani Lone, a separatist-turned-mainstream politician and founder of the People's Conference, or PC, party. The dynamics shifted, however, when incarcerated politician and former member of the legislative assembly Sheikh Abdul Rashid, popularly known as Engineer Rashid, decided to contest the election from New Delhi's Tihar jail.
Rashid is the founder of the Awami Ittehad Party. He is jailed under anti-terrorism laws.
""NC and PC have had a stronghold in north Kashmir, but this year people may surprise everyone as a large number of youth have come out in support of Engineer Rashid,"" Nazir Ahmad Reshi, a resident of the Sumbal area in Bandipora district, told VOA.
""One cannot predict the victory of any particular candidate. The youth are with Engineer Rashid while the rest of the people are with NC and PC,"" he said.
Despite having few resources to cover his campaign expenses, Engineer Rashid has attracted large support. Thousands rallied around him voluntarily when his son, Abrar Rashid, filed nomination papers on his behalf.
The elder Rashid was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir government in 2019 and later booked by the National Investigation Agency in a terror-funding case.
Simran Jan, a first-time voter, said she hoped Rashid would receive many votes.
""Engineer Rashid has always taken a strong stance and consistently advocates for the rights of Kashmiris. He is currently imprisoned due to his ideology. During the 2014 floods, he personally rescued victims using his own vehicle,"" Simran Jan said.
""Local and national political parties have consistently failed to fulfill their promises. I wish to see him free. The day he is released from prison will feel like a festival,"" she told VOA.
Rashid's detention came before the Modi government revoked the semiautonomous status of Muslim majority Kashmir in August 2019. Kashmir's loss of its special status led to the division of the region into two federal territories — Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Both areas are ruled by the central government and have no legislatures of their own.
Meanwhile, Ladakh also exercised its electoral franchise for the first time since it was separated from the previous state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Ladakh parliamentary constituency, the largest in the country in terms of area, recorded a voter turnout of approximately 67.15%, officials said.
""People of Ladakh choose this election as a referendum in order to send a message to the center government. In 2019 elections, BJP government did not fulfill the promises made by them during the previous elections,"" Padma Stanzin, a resident of the Leh district of Ladakh, told VOA. ""The local population is upset. BJP is not coming into power in Ladakh. Independent candidates and Congress Party candidates may win because of anti-incumbency against BJP as we feel that our rights are at stake.""
A candidate from Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Tashi Gyalson, and one from the main opposition party, Indian National Congress's Tsering Namgyal, are among those contesting the elections in Ladakh.
The BPJ is not contesting the elections in Indian Kashmir. News reports say the move signals ongoing discontent over the 2019 move, and there is speculation BJP candidates would have lost.

""10 years ago, people had given up on politics and politicians. Now those people have placed their hopes on BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and are moving ahead,"" he added.

He said that the Congress when Indira Gandhi was the PM, changed the Preamble of the Constitution themselves in 1976 and were now trying to raise the issue to divide the voters.
""Congress never works on a positive note. They never the country any positive message. They work with obstacle-creating powers, and always try to find issues that will divide the society,"" Mr Nadda said. 
""Congress does not like when they see something that will unite the country and take it forward. Congress only wants to divide the society and keep playing vote bank politics,"" the BJP chief added.

The BJP is hoping to win a third consecutive term and is up against a united Opposition, who are contesting under the banner of the INDIA bloc.
The BJP and its allies won 352 of the 543 seats in India's lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, in the last election in 2019 with the BJP alone winning 303 seats. The BJP is expecting to sweep the election this time, eyeing a third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He headlines the contest, followed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is largely considered the face of the opposition.

  2024-05-25 05:17:34 ET
 





   The rise of AI-generated content has brought a new dimension to the ongoing mammoth India elections.
  

   With over 800 million internet users, political parties are leveraging artificial intelligence to connect with voters in unprecedented ways.
  

   From AI-created avatars delivering personalized messages to AI-powered chatbots mimicking the voices of political leaders, the aim is clear: to influence voter behaviour on a massive scale.
  

   Driving through the bustling streets of New Delhi recently, I couldnt help but notice the digital billboards displaying eerily lifelike AI-generated videos of politicians.
  

   Technology is reshaping the electoral landscape
  

   A popular Indian YouTuber, who did not want to be named, notes,
  


    The integration of AI in political campaigns is transforming how parties communicate with voters, making their outreach more direct and seemingly personal.
   


   Social media and communication platforms are poised to become the primary conduits for deceptive generative AI-based content, regardless of their intentions. Given the low barriers to entry and the high dependency on these platforms, its inevitable that they will be exploited for the dissemination of misleading information.
  

   In environments where ease of access and widespread usage prevail, the propagation of AI-generated misinformation is almost certain.
  

   This trend underscores the pressing need for robust measures to safeguard the integrity of Indias general elections from the threats posed by deepfakes and disinformation.
  

   But disinformation and its impacts are already apparent
  

   Despite the innovative uses of AI, disinformation remains a significant challenge.
  

   The Indian Election Commission has warned against using AI to spread false information, but regulatory measures are limited.
  

   Deepfake videos featuring Bollywood stars Ranveer Singh and Aamir Khan criticizing the government went viral before being debunked.
  

   Another video falsely depicted Congress Party leader Rahul Gandhi resigning, using his AI-cloned voice.
  

   The YouTuber adds,
  


    The speed at which AI-generated content can spread false information is alarming. Its a powerful tool that, if misused, can significantly impact public perception and trust.
   

    Religion at play
   

    In early March, a realistic AI-generated image of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, styled as Bhishma Pitamah from the ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata, was promoted as a political advertisement on Instagram.
   

    The image, featuring Modi with long wavy grey hair, a sun-shaped mark on his forehead, and donning body armour, depicted him as a reincarnation of Bhishma, the supreme commander who fought against foreign threats.
   

    Created by the right-wing page Hokage Modi Sama and first posted in 2023, this image was boosted as a political advertisement for two days in March, garnering more than 35,000 impressions.
   

    The common theme across all images shared by Hokage Modi Sama was the valorization of Modi as a Hindu leader. Popular AI images boosted through sponsored posts featured Modi as a reincarnation of Bhishma, a suit-wearing son of god, and the King of Hindu Rashtra, embracing Hindu heritage and garnering millions of likes and views.
   

    Hindu Rashtra is a contentious ideology advocating for a Hindu-majoritarian rule of India, diverging from its secular founding principles.
   


   Personalized AI campaigns
  

   In constituencies with approximately two million voters each, personalized AI campaigns are becoming more common.
  

   AI avatars addressing voters by name and AI chatbots calling constituents in the voices of political leaders are strategies used to create a direct and personalized connection with voters.
  

   These methods aim to enhance voter engagement and influence voting behaviour.
  

   India, with the worlds largest number of YouTube and Instagram users, sees political parties increasingly mobilizing social media influencers to sway voters. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been particularly proactive.
  

   In March, the Prime Minister awarded 24 prominent social media influencers at the National Creators Award ceremony, promoting the governments narrative.
  

   The role of YouTube influencers
  

   A political commentator observed, The use of social media influencers in political campaigns blurs the lines between genuine political discourse and promotional content. It raises questions about the authenticity of the messages being delivered to the public.
  

   State units of the BJP have been organizing influencer meetings to disseminate the governments achievements. Prominent politicians and ministers have participated in interviews with influencers, further integrating these personalities into their campaign strategies.
  

   The impact of AI on voter behaviour
  

   The critical question remains: Can AI and deepfake content significantly change voter behaviour?
  

   Prateek Waghre, Executive Director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, points out that in the Indian context, political parties already rely heavily on narratives and misleading messages.
  

   The additional impact of synthetic content is still uncertain. However, the potential for AI to influence young voters is notable. AI-generated content, such as videos of Prime Minister Modi singing popular Tamil songs, has helped expand his reach and portray him as a more approachable leader.
  



   The future of AI in elections
  

   As AI technology continues to evolve, its role in elections is likely to grow. The affordability and accessibility of AI tools mean that political campaigns can produce personalized and persuasive content at scale. However, the ethical implications and potential for misuse pose significant challenges.
  

   The use of AI, deepfakes, and social media influencers in the Indian elections represents a significant shift in political campaigning.
  

   While these tools offer innovative ways to engage voters, they also raise concerns about disinformation and ethical practices.
  

   Narendra Modi, in a chat with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in March, said:
  


    In a democratic and large country like India , if someone uses deepfake, for example they use my voice over a nasty video, then people will believe at first, it will lead to a wildfire. Therefore it is important that deepfake and AI generated mention sources to start with in the beginning. We will have to seriously think about some Dos and Donts.
   


   As India navigates this digital election landscape, the balance between innovation and integrity will be crucial in ensuring a fair and democratic process.
  

   The data suggests that AIs impact on voter behaviour is growing, but its full potential and implications are yet to be fully understood.

Uttar Pradesh, India's most politically significant state which sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha,witnessed an epic battle between the ruling NDA and the opposition INDIA bloc comprising Samajwadi Party and Congress on Tuesday.
Even though Prime Minister Narendra Modiwon the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat for a third time, his National Democratic Alliance (NDA)faced a shocking result in UP, which was the BJP's big bastion in the past two general elections.
According to the Election Commission figures, the BJP secured 33 seats and its allies got three (the Rashtriya Lok Dal won in two constituencies and Apna Dal (Soneylal) was victorious in one).
On the other hand, the INDIA bloc made a stunning comeback and won 43 seats. While Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party won 37 seats, Congress secured six Lok Sabha constituencies.
Chandrashekhar of the Azad Samaj Party (Kanshiram) won from the Nagina seat.

In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP alone won 62 of the 80 seats, while the BSP and Samajwadi Party, then allies, won 10 and five seats, respectively.

He was to reaffirm that the new Ram temple in Ayodhya represented a cultural assertion for India's majority Hindus. Even foreign policy was anticipated to influence the ballot, with the publicity boost afforded by Mr Modi's hosting of the G20 summit last September. Opinion polls have predicted a third, record-equalling landslide win for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
But early in the gruelling six-week election, Mr Modi's campaign shifted gears, using divisive rhetoric that has raised questions about his tactics. He's been accusing the opposition, led by the Congress party, of appeasing the Muslim minority community.
Muslims make up 14% of India's more than 1.4 billion people. Taking a cue from Mr Modi's campaign, social media posts by the BJP have, according to the opposition, ""demonised"" Muslims.
He told a rally on 21 April that the opposition Congress wanted to distribute wealth to ""infiltrators"" and to ""those who have many children"". His remarks were widely seen as referring to Muslims. 
At another rally, he warned women that the opposition would confiscate their gold and redistribute it to Muslims. He accused the Congress of orchestrating a ""vote jihad"", urging a ""certain community"" to unite against him. Mr Modi even said the Congress would select the Indian cricket team ""on the basis of religion"". 
India's 200 million Muslims make up 14% of the country's population
That's not all. In a recent interview Mr Modi said the ""whole world"" was trying to influence the elections. This week, Mr Modi blamed the Congress for taking ""truckloads"" of money from billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has long spoken about the close ties that Mr Modi shares with the country's two richest men. 
""For the first time you have spoken in public about Adani and Ambani. Is it your personal experience that you know they give money in trucks?"" Mr Gandhi responded in a video message. Neither businessman has reacted to the comments.
India's opposition has also accused Mr Modi of Islamophobia, calling his remarks ""divisive, hate speech"". The Congress has demanded an investigation into a potential code of conduct violation. Since the BJP's rise to power, hate speech against India's 200 million Muslims has increased. But Mr Modi's fiery rhetoric on the stump has surprised many, as they expected a focus on highlighting his achievements instead. 
""To be honest, I thought Mr Modi's campaign would be much more about the rising India story, and about what they had done for the people,"" says Rahul Verma of the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), a Delhi-based think tank. 
Others say Mr Modi's remarks are not unprecedented. They point to many such instances during his previous election campaigns, including what they call his ""inflammatory rhetoric"" after the riots in Gujarat in 2002 ahead of the state's assembly elections. ""So, it has not surprised me, but is has shocked me. We often refer to such rhetoric as dog-whistling but there was nothing subtle about the language being employed,"" says Milan Vaishnav of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
There has been a significant dip in the turnout of voters in the early phases of the election
For one, many say, the BJP might have been spooked by a significant dip in turnout in early rounds of voting amid what has been a rather low energy election. In the previous two elections, won decisively by the BJP, high turnouts benefitted the party - 2014 was largely a vote against the Congress, and 2019 was a vote for Mr Modi. 
Second, the opposition has been trying to reshape the narrative of the 2024 election, shifting focus from being solely a referendum on Mr Modi to campaigning on issues like unemployment, social justice and economic inequality.
Political scientist Neelanjan Sircar suggests that the BJP excels in national elections when it focuses on overarching national issues. He told a podcast, external recently that the party's not ""playing its strongest game"" when elections become more regionalised, and local factors come into play.
Mr Modi's party is targeting 370 seats this time, up from 303 in 2019. However, their rallying cry of ""Abki Baar, 400 par""  (This time, above 400), aiming for the party and its allies to secure a landslide, might have backfired. The opposition appears to have seized on the slogan, portraying the BJP as a dominating force set to reshape India with a massive majority.
""The opposition is using this slogan to say if they come with such huge majority, the BJP will change the constitution. And the opposition's narrative to empower poor and lower castes might have got some traction given there are high levels of economic anxiety evident in the pre-poll surveys,"" says Mr Verma. ""This might have provoked Mr Modi to take this narrative head on and give it a Hindu-Muslim twist.""
Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party has led the criticism of Mr Modi's remarks
Is Mr Modi's divisive rhetoric a sign of desperation? 
Not really, says Mr Vaishnav. ""To me, it is designed to mobilise his cadres and perhaps to make up for an underwhelming performance in the first few phases.
""Desperation suggests that the BJP is losing, which I do not believe to be the case. Meeting the new target of 400 seats will be difficult unless the BJP can retain its seats from 2019 as well as expand into new areas.""
Despite Mr Modi's rhetoric on the stump, he has sung a different tune in recent interviews with news networks.
""I am not anti-Islam, nor am I anti-Muslim,"" he told Times Now, external.
He said his government's welfare benefits extended to all, irrespective of their community or religion, adding that ""social justice and secularism is a guarantee from Modi"". 
Mr Modi criticised the opposition for using Muslims as political pawns and suggested that the community should reflect on its own situation. ""Muslims should introspect why there's a sense of shortcomings within the community."" He said the Muslim community was changing all over the world. ""When I go to the Gulf countries, India and I get so much respect. Here there's opposition,"" he said.
Unravelling the complexity behind election victories in India is always a challenge. Gilles Verniers, a political scientist, believes they are rarely fought and won based on past accomplishments.
""Voters instead determine their choice according to what parties and candidates offer for the future. After building its past campaigns on welfare, security and nationalism, and having scored on these matters, the BJP does not have a lot of new ideas to offer to voters, hence the exacerbation of ethnic and religious nationalism,"" he says. 
Mr Modi and his party will disagree. But one thing is evident: this election has not yet manifested itself as a sweeping wave favouring any side, regardless of which party stands to gain or lose from it. ""In politics,"" says political analyst Pratap Bhanu Mehta, ""never underestimate the power of boredom, external"". That could account for what many say is the BJP's ""nervousness"".

What DMK Leader Said,DMK Organising Secretary RS Bharathi has said that if by any chance the results of the Lok Sabha elections do not come in the favour of the INDIA bloc on Monday it would be due to the disunity among certain leaders who are part of the coalition.,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/lok-sabha-election-results-2024-india-bloc-disunity-threatens-election-performance-dmk-leader-says-5804679,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/ve49tcng_india-bloc_625x300_03_June_24.jpeg?ver-20240506.08,2024-06-03T05:07:33Z,"File photo
DMK Organising Secretary RS Bharathi has said that if by any chance the results of the Lok Sabha elections do not come in the favour of the INDIA bloc, it would be due to the disunity among certain leaders who are part of the coalition.
The DMK leader told IANS that there should not be any negligence on the part of the party agents who are present during the counting of votes.
He said that during certain state Assembly elections, the winning margin was very low.

Mr Bharathi added that the DMK had made adjustments with the opposition coalition partners and has even reduced its seat tally from 24 in 2019 to 21 in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls for the best interests of the INDIA bloc coalition.
He said that ""if something goes wrong, then it would be due to certain parties and leaders not adjusting with other coalition partners in the best interests of the INDIA bloc coalition"".
He also cited the examples of West Bengal and Kerala.
The senior DMK leader, however, said that the Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, had worked hard and there were huge crowds present at the rallies of both leaders.
Mr Bharathi added that due to the high voltage campaign of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was forced to alter his campaign schedule.
Before the different Exit Poll results were announced on Saturday, IANS had reported of DMK leadership not averse to switching sides and entering into an alliance with the NDA if the NDA falls short of a majority in forming the government at the Centre.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'NDTV News'}",,Fact Check: Did Rahul Gandhi Hold Up Chinese Constitution At His Rallies?,"A photo of Rahul Gandhi, an Indian politician and leader of the Congress party, holding a book with a red cover is going viral on social media.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/fact-check-did-rahul-gandhi-hold-up-chinese-constitution-at-his-rallies-5697297,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-05/4cmok9hs_rahul-gandhi-constitution_625x300_19_May_24.jpeg?ver-20240506.08,2024-05-19T08:44:45Z,"A photo of Rahul Gandhi, an Indian politician and leader of the Congress party, holding a book with a red cover is going viral on social media. The accompanying claim suggests that Gandhi is holding a copy of the 'original Chinese constitution,' which is said to have a 'red cover,' in contrast to the 'original Indian constitution,' which supposedly has a 'blue cover.'
The claim was first posted (archived here) by BJP leader and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on May 17. Taking to X, he stated, 'The original copy of the Constitution of India has a blue cover. The original Chinese constitution has a red cover. Is Rahul carrying a Chinese Constitution? We need to verify.'
Sarma seemed to further justify his statement when he posted (archived here) again on X on May 18, saying, ""Rahul is displaying a red Chinese constitution to the people attending his meetings. Our constitution, which is blue, includes a chapter called the Directive Principles of State Policy. This chapter makes it a sacred duty to enact a Uniform Civil Code in our country. Rahul is now opposing this. That's why I am sure that the constitution in his hand must be a Chinese one.""

Sarma's first post included two distinct images: one of the Chinese constitution with a red cover and another of the Indian constitution with a blue cover. Other social media users subsequently picked up and reshared this post. Archived versions of such posts can be viewed here, here, here, and here.

Screenshot of the viral social media posts. (Source: X/Modified by Logically Facts)
What are the facts?
The exact image of Gandhi with the red-covered book was found on the Press Trust of India (PTI) website(archive link)with the caption, ""Congress leader Rahul Gandhi addresses during a public meeting for Lok Sabha polls, in Gadwal, Telangana, Sunday, May 5, 2024. (PTI Photo).""

Rahul Gandhi's image on the PTI Photos website. (Source: PTI Photos/Modified by Logically Facts)
Drawing from this, we were able to access a video from the same event in Gadwal, where Gandhi delivered his speech. He posted a livestream on YouTube (archived here) titled ""Lok Sabha 2024 Campaign | Public Meeting | Gadwal, Telangana,"" on May 5, 2024. At the 29:17 mark, the cover of the book he was holding, clearly marked with the words ""The Constitution of India,"" is visible.

While holding the book, Gandhi stated in Hindi, ""...if the poor, OBCs, Dalits, and tribes in the country have gained anything, it is because of this book, our constitution. If you have employment, daily wages, public sectors, and reservations, it's all because of this book. Before its existence, India had no rights for you all. This book protects the rights of all sections of people: the OBC, minorities, tribes, and general castes. And the BJP wants to tear this book. This book is the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar, and Jawaharlal Nehru..."" The reference here clearly refers to the Constitution of India.
The Telangana Youth Congress also posted (archived version) a similar photo of Gandhi holding the red-covered copy of the Indian constitution on April 29, 2024.
Constitution of India with a red cover
In our search for a red-covered Indian constitution book, we found a specific edition by Gopal Sankaranarayanan titled 'Constitution of India (Coat Pocket Edition),' published by Eastern Book Company (EBC). This book is available on the EBC Webstore, an online law bookstore, and the Amazon online shopping platform. We observed that this EBC edition matches the copy Gandhi was holding in the viral image.
Other leaders with the red cover copy
This isn't the first time a politician has been seen holding this copy. Previously, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and former President of India Ram Nath Kovind were seen with a copy of the book.
On October 23, 2023, the online legal research database SCC Online (archive link) (published by EBC) posted an image of Shah receiving a copy and wrote, ""EBC Directors, Mr. Sumain Malik, and Mr. Sumeet Malik, present a copy of the Coat Pocket Constitution to Mr. Amit Shah, Minister of Home Affairs of India.""
Similarly, The Statesman published a report on July 26, 2017, featuring a photo of Modi presenting a similar copy of the constitution to the then-president Ram Nath Kovind.
On July 15, 2021, Draupadi Murmu (archive link), President of India, posted an image showing Kovind receiving a copy from Shri Mangubhai Chhaganbhai Patel, Governor of Madhya Pradesh.

Blue cover version of Indian constitution
ATimes of India report from January 30, 2024, titled ""How they made sure India's Constitution lasts for ages,"" included the image now used in viral posts to depict the 'original blue-covered Constitution.' According to the report, the original handwritten copies of the Constitution of India are preserved inside the Parliament Library in display cases.
Constitution controversy
Gandhi initially asked all party candidates to carry a copy of the constitution during nominations and public meetings, and he started doing the same himself. BJP president JP Nadda even accused Gandhi of only carrying a copy of the constitution but not reading it.
On May 17, 2024, Gandhi brought up this issue at a rally with Samajwadi Party Chief Akhilesh Yadav. Here, Gandhi criticized Modi for allegedly attempting to undermine citizens' constitutional values and rights. This was followed by Sarma questioning whether Gandhi was carrying a 'red-covered Chinese constitution.'
The verdict
In the viral image, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is seen holding a coat pocket version of the Constitution of India by Gopal Sankaranarayanan (published by EBC). Therefore, the claim that Gandhi was carrying a copy of the Chinese constitution is false.

In 2019, Rahul Gandhi secured 65% of the vote share, winning over seven lakh votes.Mr Gandhi secured an impressive victory, triumphing over PP Suneer of the CPI by an impressive margin of 4.31 lakh votes.
The hill constituency has been the Congress leader's primary seat since his defeat to BJP's Smriti Irani in Amethi, a former Congress bastion.
The competition has sparked significant public attention, especially given that the Congress and CPI are part of the INDIA alliance.During campaigning, Rahul Gandhi addressed over 100 rallies and public interaction programmes nationwide.

NEW DELHI, May 18: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said opposition INDIA bloc can go to any extent in pursuing its vote bank politics, claiming that the then Congress government during the 2014 elections had handed over 123 properties spread across prime locations in Delhi to the Waqf Board for votes.
In his first rally in the national capital for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Modi slammed the Congress-AAP alliance in Delhi as opportunistic, saying the world is watching how one corrupt party is covering for another corrupt party.
Modi asserted that if he has any heir, it is the 140 crore Indians for whose bright future he has dedicated himself. His every moment is for the country and his life is dedicated to realising the dreams of its citizens, the prime ministers said while addressing the rally in North-East Delhi.
Though he made no direct reference, Modis remarks came amid repeated claims of Delhi Chief Minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal that he will make way for home minister Amit Shah after he turns 75 next year.
He has chosen Shah as his successor, Kejriwal has claimed, an assertion refuted by top BJP leaders who have said Modi will lead the party even after 2029.
Listing several signature projects, including the new Parliament building and the war memorial, Prime Minister Modi asserted that he lives and works hard for democracy.
It is Modi in whose heart democracy is alive, he said, noting that his government has built a museum dedicated to all the prime ministers.
This Congress-AAP alliance seems determined to destroy Delhi, he said, adding that its leaders are responsible for fall in political standards and breaking peoples faith.
Those who arrived to root out corruption are doing the rounds of jail in scams running into thousands of crores of rupees, Modi said in a swipe at chief minister Kejriwal.
The Congress, he said, would not tire of taking credit for exposing the AAP governments scams but its Delhi leaders were forced by the Gandhi family to join hands with the citys ruling party.
Keeping up his attack on the opposition alliance for its alleged pro-Muslim politics, Modi said the Congress had joined hands with those advocating for vote jihad for its vote bank during the 2014 elections.
It was agreed that they would vote for the Congress, and its government in turn handed over the countrys properties to the Waqf Board, he said.
These properties were spread across prime locations where a yard of land costs many lakh of rupees, Modi said, claiming that the opportunist opposition alliance can incite violence for its appeasement politics.
Prime Minister Modi blamed them (opposition) for the 2020 Delhi riots following the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and noted that many people, mostly Dalits, who were persecuted in neighbouring countries were recently granted citizenship under the law.
The opposition alliance supports reservation on religious ground, restoration of Article 370 and abolition of Indias nuclear bombs, he claimed. (PTI)",-0.0247,Neutral,BJP

Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav engaged in a free-wheeling conversation on stage at Prayagraj's Phulpur as their public meeting got cancelled owing to a stampede-like situation at the public rally.
The Samajwadi Party chief has often claimed that the INDIA bloc will be winning 79 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh and will be facing a cut-throat contest at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency Varanasi which he referred to as 'Kyoto'.
""The Prime MP (PM Modi) had promised the people of Kashi that 'Kyoto' will be the world's best city. Whether it became a reality or not will be determined by the people of Kashi in the elections.""

Akhilesh's reference to Kyoto is a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had promised that his government would be developing Varanasi in the style of Japan's Kyoto city.

Taking a veiled dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, ""This time Mann ki Baat won't work. They have to listen to us, 140 crore people and that of the Constitution.""
Speaking about unemployment, Rahul Gandhi said, ""PM Modi has made Uttar Pradesh the centre of unemployment.""
Pointing at the jeering crowd, Akhilesh Yadav said, ""These are those youths who did not get jobs owing to Agniveer or paper leak. The false promises given by the BJP of Investment Meets, Defence Expo or those dreams sold at the G20 Summit are visible.""
Speaking about his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, the Samajwadi Party chief said, ""He was very attached to the ground. I have learnt several things from Netaji starting from his hard work, his determination to stay focussed on his goal and his fight for equality started by Ram Manohar Lohia.""
Pointing out the strength of their alliance, Rahul Gandhi said, ""The INDIA alliance that has been formed this time has never been seen. All the parties are together in the fight.""
On the alliance between the Samajwadi Party and the Congress, Mr Yadav said, ""This is a natural alliance and people can see that. The youth can connect with us because we are highlighting issues like employment.""
In an attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr Yadav said, ""The BJP acts on its own will.""
To this Rahul Gandhi added, ""They think that there is no need for discussion because they know everything.""
Highlighting the importance of holding discussions, Mr Yadav said, ""The more there are discussions, the more we listen to others and trust others, the stronger will be our democracy. The BJP has not only endangered our lives but is also posing a threat to our democracy and our Constitution.""
Speaking about the alleged threat from neighbouring China, Mr Yadav said, ""Our borders with China at Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh are very insecure. On top of that China also posed a threat to our markets. So we need to give a boost to our manufacturing sector.""
On ensuing reservations to all castes in every sector of the society, Mr Yadav said, ""Social justice, caste census is important for the country. America and European countries undertake several welfare measures for those who are left behind. This will play a major role in our country to uplift those people who are left behind based on caste.""

Uttar Pradesh which contributes the maximum number of seats to the Lok Sabha elections is voting in all seven phases. According to the seat-sharing agreement between the two parties, the Samajwadi Party is contesting 63 seats while the Congress is contesting 17.

A Fact-Check,"A video of a woman criticizing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been shared online with the false claim that it is Subhashini Ali, a leader of the CPM, which is in alliance with the grand old party.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/did-cpms-subhashini-ali-criticise-rahul-gandhi-on-camera-a-fact-check-5592674,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-05/lke2d7eo_subhashini-ali-fake-video_625x300_05_May_24.jpg,2024-05-05T07:31:10Z,"A closer look at the video revealed multiple facial dissimilarities with the CPM leader.
A video of a woman criticizing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been shared online with the false claim that it is Subhashini Ali, a leader of the CPM, which is in alliance with the grand old party.
A video circulating on social media platforms amid the 2024 Indian Lok Sabha elections depicts an older woman criticizing Rahul Gandhi and referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a ""beacon of peace"". Multiple users have claimed that the woman in the video is Subhashini Ali, a leader of the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M).
In the video, the woman, speaking in Hindi, says, ""If you want the nation to progress, please don't mention Rahul Gandhi. He lacks knowledge about politics and the country."" She further praises PM Modi, stating, ""If you want to save the country, we should vote for Modi. He has handled the whole country, and we should be grateful to him. He is saving us from the wars that are happening around the world, and I think he is a beacon of peace."" (Translated to English)
One post on X (formerly Twitter), which shared the video, wrote, ""Please listen to @SubhashiniAli Ji on Polling preference (assume she said so). She has this advice for the public! All are requested to Vote AND Please Vote Wisely In the Interest Of Bharat.""

The post (archived here) has garnered around 26,000 views on the platform at the time of writing this story. Other archived versions of such posts on X can be found here and here. Multiple Facebook users have also shared the clip with similar claims; those archives can be viewed here and here.
However, our investigation revealed that the woman in the viral clip had been misidentified. She is not CPI-M leader Subhashini Ali.
Upon careful observation of the viral video, we noticed the logo ""99 Khabar"" on a microphone. A Google search led us to the YouTube channel under the same name. We found a longer version of the viral clip on the channel, uploaded on January 29, 2024. The title, written in Hindi, roughly translates to, ""Why are beautiful girls angry with Rahul Gandhi? Modi vs Rahul Gandhi Public Opinion. Lok Sabha Election 2024."" The same woman can be seen expressing her opinion in the video from the 6:55 to 8:00-minute timestamp.
We also identified the same woman in another public opinion video uploaded by the same organization, 99 Khabar, on its Instagram (archived here) account on March 12, 2024. Here, too, she can be heard praising PM Modi.
However, the woman's name or identity has not been reported in either of the videos. If it were the opinion of CPI-M leader Subhashini Ali, as claimed, it would likely be stated in the YouTube video report, which terms the video as 'public opinion'. Other media organizations would also have covered it, but we found no such media report about Ms Ali praising PM Narendra Modi.
While it is true that the woman in the viral image does bear some resemblance to Subhashini Ali at first glance, a closer look revealed multiple facial dissimilarities.
We also compared the woman's voice in the viral clip to Subhashini Ali's previous interviews and found distinct differences in pitch, tone, and voice modulation.
Furthermore, Subhashini Ali (archived here) has also posted a clarification on her official X account, stating, ""This is a fake video attributed to me. Not me. Not my voice. Not my views. I have reported it to ECI and police. Let's see what they do.""

Speaking to Logically Facts, she once again reiterated that the viral video does not feature her. Logically Facts has also contacted 99 Khabar and will update the story as and when we receive a response.
A viral video of an older woman expressing her views on PM Modi and criticizing Rahul Gandhi has been falsely attributed to CPI-M leader Subhashini Ali and misrepresented as her political opinion amid the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Therefore, we have marked the claim as false.

The last time the party boasted a triple-digit score was in 2009 when it won 206 seats and propelled former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the United Progressive Alliance to a second term.
At 11 pm the Congress had won 85 seats - including the Amethi bastion in Uttar Pradesh it lost to the BJP's Smriti Irani in the 2019 election - across the country and was leading in 14 others.
And the party-led INDIA bloc - set up in June 2023 to beat Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP-led National Democratic Alliance - was ahead in 232, which is short of its claim of 295.

The NDA was leading in 292 seats; the ruling party had quickly surged past the halfway mark of 272 in early leads as counting began (starting with postal ballots) but slowed down as the hours went by.
At 11 pm the BJP, on its own, had won 221 - well short of its target of 370 - and was leading in 19. The party had set its NDA partners a target of 30 more seats which, interestingly, they have delivered.

Prime Minister Modi, therefore, is set for a historic third term, but the BJP's hope of crossing the 400-seat mark - something only the Congress has done - has hit an INDIA wall.

What Happened In 2014?
In 2014 the Congress - then led by Rahul Gandhi - faced the much-vaunted 'Modi wave' and slumped to a massive defeat, losing 162 seats and dropping nearly 9.3 per cent of the vote share.
The 2014 election saw the emergence of the Hindi heartland - the belt of Hindi-speaking states from Gujarat and Rajasthan in the west to Bihar and Jharkhand in the east, and down to Madhya Pradesh.
The BJP swept these states 10 years ago en route to winning 336 of the nation's 543 seats.

On its own the saffron party won 282 seats.
The NDA won 73 seats in UP, 41 in Maharashtra, 31 in Bihar, and 27 in Madhya Pradesh. It also swept Gujarat's 26, Rajasthan's 25, Delhi's seven, Himachal Pradesh's four, and Uttarakhand's five seats, and won 12 of Jharkhand's 14, 10 of Chhattisgarh's 11, and seven of Haryana's 10 seats.
The Congress won just two seats in UP - the party strongholds of Amethi and Raebareli. The party picked up only six seats across the rest of the belt, with its UPA partners contributing a further six.
Five years on the BJP eked further ahead, winning 303 seats on its own and 353 with allies.
Once again the Hindi belt was key to beating the Congress' hopes, with the party picking up 74 in UP, 39 in Bihar, and 28 in Madhya Pradesh. It also swept Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Delhi, winning 77 seats from these states.
Adding Chhattisgarh's nine and Jharkhand's 11, the BJP amassed 238 seats from this belt.
The Congress, this time contesting under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, slumped badly yet again, picking up just six seats on its own and seven with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha.
More seriously, Mr Gandhi suffered a shock defeat from UP's Amethi constituency; the Congress leader, looking to claim a fourth consecutive win, instead lost badly to the BJP's Smriti Irani.
Mr Gandhi resigned from his position as Congress President after the defeat, and remained adamant that he would not reconsider his decision despite of wave of objections from Gandhi family loyalists.
Two of 12 exit pollsters - India Today-Axis My India and India TV-CNX - believed the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could amass as much as 401 seats. A third - News24-Today's Chanakya - said it will land spot on the 400-seat mark, and three others - ABP News-C Voter, Jan Ki Baat, and News Nation - gave Mr Modi's election-winning juggernaut a maximum of 383, 392, and 378 seats.

The INDIA bloc - seen by many as a ragtag bunch of opposition parties - laughed off the predictions and vowed it would do what it set out to in June last year - defeat Prime Minister Modi and the BJP.
Congress boss Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi insisted the group would win 295 seats.
Exit poll data disagreed; although four give the bloc 150+ seats.
TV9 Bharatvarsh-Polstrat, Times Now-ETG, and Republic TV-P Marq said the INDIA group will win 166, 152, and 154 seats, while News Nation and ABP News-C Voter predicted hauls between 152 and 182.

The seat has flipped between Farooq and Omar Abdullah's National Conference and Mehbooba Mufti's PDP over the last five elections.
The focus, though, will be on the national capital, where the BJP faces an INDIA bloc challenge - the AAP and Congress have united to stop the former from claiming a hat-trick of clean sweeps. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party won all seven in 2014 and 2019.
The AAP contests four seats - New Delhi, East Delhi, South Delhi, and West Delhi. The Congress has fielded candidates in three - Chandni Chowk, North-East, and North-West.

In a curious twist the AAP has dominated Assembly elections in Delhi since 2013, but the BJP has been the top dog in Lok Sabha polls. In 2019, for example, the BJP had a vote share of nearly 57 per cent and the AAP just 18 per cent. A year later, in the 2020 state election, the AAP thumped its rival by winning 62 of 70 seats and a vote share of nearly 54 per cent.
While winning (or losing) one or all of seven seats is unlikely to make or break the election for either the ruling BJP or opposition parties, claiming Delhi is a prestige issue.
Among the big names contesting in Delhi this time is the BJP's Bansuri Swaraj, who is the late former Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj's daughter. She is contesting the New Delhi seat against the AAP's Somnath Bharti. This seat was claimed by the BJP's Meenakshi Lekhi in 2014 and 2019, and the Congress' Ajay Maken for the two prior elections.
In North-East Delhi, meanwhile, the BJP's Manoj Tiwari is looking for a hat-trick of wins of his own, but must overcome the not insignificant challenge of Kanhaiya Kumar, the Congress' fiery youth leader from the city's Jawaharlal Nehru University.
Elsewhere in the country, there are eight seats voting in Bengal, including Tamluk and Kanthi. These are in the family stronghold of Suvendhu Adhikari, who was Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's right-hand man till he quit - amid huge controversy - to join the BJP.
Since then, Mr Adhikari and Ms Banerjee have become implacable rivals, even going head-to-head for the Nandigram Assembly constituency in the 2021 state election that the Trinamool dominated. However, in a statement result from the seat that catapulted Ms Banerjee to power he defeated her, forcing her into a by-poll to remain Chief Minister.
Tamluk is also significant because the BJP has fielded former Calcutta High Court judge Abhijit Ganguly from here, who has lost no time in needling the Trinamool boss. He faces the ruling party's youth wing leader - Debangshu Bhattacharya. Meanwhile, in Kanthi the BJP's Soumendu Adhikari - Mr Adhikari's brother - faces the Trinamool's Uttam Barik.
The BJP won five of these seats last time. The Trinamool got three.
Eight seats in Bihar are also voting in this phase. Bihar was dominated by the BJP and the party-led NDA in the last election. That alliance won 39 of the state's 40 seats. Of the seats voting today, last time the BJP got four and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JDU got three.
The eighth was won by the Lok Janshakti Party.
All three are allied again now after a headline-grabbing U-turn by Nitish Kumar - who helped found the INDIA bloc - and the LJP of Chirag Paswan eased to the BJP's side.
Uttar Pradesh, which like Bengal will vote in every phase of this election, sends 14 seats to the polling booths in this round. UP is a politically key state since it has 80 Lok Sabha seats.
The BJP has dominated electoral politics here since the 2017 Assembly election and claimed 62 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll (64 including two won by ally Apna Dal (S)), and will want another big win to help hit its target of 'abki baar, 400 paar'.
In 2019 the BJP secured nine of these 14 seats and the Bahujan Samaj Party - not an INDIA member - got four. The Samajwadi Party, which is part of bloc, picked up the odd seat.
All 14 seats are in western UP and include the temple town of Prayagraj and jailed SP leader Aam Khan's Azamgarh bastion that is now with the BJP. It was held by SP patriarch Mulayam Yadav in 2014 and his son Akhilesh Yadav in 2019. However, in the 2022 by-poll - triggered after Akhilesh Yadav quit to retain an Assembly seat - it was picked up by the BJP.
Seats polling in UP today also includes Phulpur, where a Akhilesh Yadav-Rahul Gandhi rally saw chaos because the SP and Congress' supporters were overeager to see their leaders.
Six seats are voting, and the big battles are for capital Bhubaneshwar, Sambalpur and Puri.
In Sambalpur the BJD's Pranab Prakash Das faces off against a BJP heavyweight - Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is also being seen as a potential chief ministerial candidate in the Assembly election that is happening simultaneously. This is Mr Pradhan's first Lok Sabha election since 2009. The seat was won by the BJP's Nitesh Deb in 2019.
Over in Puri, the BJP's fiery spokesperson, Sambit Patra is hoping to do what he could not last year. In 2019 Mr Patra lost this seat to the BJD's Pinaki Mishra by a one per cent margin.
The state capital sees a three-way fight - Aparajita Sarangi of the BJP (and the incumbent) vs the BJD's Manmath Routray vs the Congress' Yasir Nawaz.
Haryana's 10 seats will all vote today. The math is simple for the BJP - win all of them.
The saffron party claimed all 10 seats in the 2019 election and will expect nothing less this time, particularly since the state is part of its Hindi heartland stronghold.
The list of big names here begins with former Chief Minister ML Khattar, who is contesting the Karnal seat against Divyanshu Budhiraja from of the Congress.
For Kurukshetra the BJP has fielded Naveen Jindal against the AAP's Sushil Gupta; a third candidate in the form of the INLD's Abhay Singh Chautala adds a touch of the unknown. There is some Bollywood glamour in Gurgaon, where the Congress has fielded former actor Raj Babbar.
Haryana is another state where the INDIA bloc is present, with the Congress and AAP sharing seats.
The seventh and final phase of the election is on June 1.

by  Ellen Ioanes
Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, greets supporters at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters during election results night in New Delhi, India, on June 4, 2024. 
Narendra Modi will be sworn in for his third term as India’s prime minister on Sunday after winning the post again in India’s momentous 2024 elections. But this week’s elections delivered a shocking blow to Modi’s dominance and will likely curb his autocratic tendencies. 
There was never any serious doubt that Modi would remain in the top spot; he faced no credible opposition during the last two elections. And heading into this year’s six-week-long staggered election, he was widely expected to further consolidate his hold over Indian politics. 
But surprisingly, he did not: Not only did Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lose a huge number of parliamentary seats to a revitalized opposition coalition, but it also lost big in states where it has enjoyed massive popularity, including Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state. Modi campaigned on a promise to win more than 400 seats, which would have given his coalition more than enough power to amend the constitution, which requires a two-thirds majority, or 362 seats. Even though he won this year’s contest, he has for now failed in his ambition to further consolidate power. 
And that has real consequences: He’ll likely face new constraints on his increasingly authoritarian leadership thanks to a renewed opposition coalition — and possibly from within his own coalition, too.
Modi is still a popular politician, but the BJP has failed to deliver on an economic front for many Indians, from farmers to young university graduates. “It seems clear that one thing that the opposition did very well was put the attention on things like unemployment and inflation,” Rohini Pande, director of the Economic Growth Center at Yale University, told Vox. 
Modi has “been in power for 10 years,” Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Vox. “He made some pretty lofty promises. And running on the cult of personality after 10 years is harder to do than it was the first time around or the second time around ... There’s no dominant kind of emotive issue in the ether. People are kind of asking, ‘Well, what have you done for me lately?’”
That kind of messaging — about people’s material concerns, rather than the Hindu nationalism and cult of personality that characterized the Modi and BJP campaigns — helped propel the once-dominant Congress Party, led by political scion Rahul Gandhi, and its coalition partners to surprising victories in parliament and throughout the country. 
It’s too early to tell whether these elections will move the country away from the Hindutva, or the Hindu supremacist ideology that the BJP has championed; the opposition coalition is untested and could prove to be fractious and fragile. And, again, Modi still won, as evidenced by his upcoming inauguration on Sunday. But the bigger picture is that, at least for now, the Indian electorate is pushing back against his authoritarian and populist policies and re-entrenching the democratic principles, including secularism, on which its constitution is based.
The BJP’s stronghold has traditionally been in poorer northern states, like Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (UP for short), which is India’s most populous state and has the most seats in the Lok Sabha, the equivalent of the US House of Representatives. That made the BJP’s massive loss in UP perhaps the biggest surprise of the election. Going into the contest, many experts believed there was no way Modi and his party could lose the state where it fulfilled an existential Hindu nationalist goal, constructing a temple for the god Ram on the remains of the Babri Masjid, a storied mosque destroyed by rioters in 1992. That riot, tacitly sanctioned by local authorities, boosted the profile of the BJP and led to a decades-long court fight about whether the Ram Mandir could be constructed. In the face of protests, Modi consecrated the temple earlier this year.
The BJP also lost seats in Maharashtra, the coastal state home to Mumbai — one of India’s most politically and economically important cities — as well as the agricultural states of Haryana, Rajasthan, and Punjab. Those three states have been rocked by extensive farmers’ protests which have severely damaged Modi’s credibility there. 
But the party’s loss in UP is the most symbolically and politically significant of all; in terms of American politics, it would be similar to former President Donald Trump losing Texas or Florida in this year’s coming election. 
“Losing UP meant that he dropped below the majority mark, majority number” of parliamentary seats in the Lok Sabha, Ashutosh Varshney, director of the Saxena Center for Contemporary South Asia at Brown University, told Vox. “The UP was critical for that.” 
Inflation and lack of job creation primarily drove BJP’s losses, Paul Kenny, professor of political science at Australian Catholic University, told Vox.
“So like Trump, in a way, he really took a hit with Covid,” he said. “Inflation has really kind of gone through the roof, and employment — especially urban unemployment and youth unemployment — has also [been a] reason. So when you look at inflation of about 6 percent, and food inflation of even higher, maybe 8 percent, that really affects the poor. And inflation in particular, is a really strong indicator of incumbent reelection success, especially in developing countries.”
But there were other problems, including concerns that Muslims and people from marginalized castes had about their constitutional protections under Modi. The BJP’s tactic of silencing critics via arrests and threats may have begun to wear on people, though it’s not clear how much that influenced their choices in the polling booth. 
“This qualifies as a climate of fear,” Varshney said. “But the climate of fear is not such that it would stop them from going to the polling booth. No, they’ll go and vote. What it’s doing is impeding the conversation before that.” That climate of fear may have contributed to the surprise results — politicians and pollsters couldn’t predict that people would vote against the BJP because they weren’t saying so aloud. 
Gandhi’s campaign filtered voters’ concerns — about the economy, their rights, and massive inequality — through the lens of the constitution. The opposition made the argument that if the BJP won a majority in the parliament, it would make unfavorable constitutional amendments, Varshney said. “In every rally — every single rally — Rahul Gandhi had a copy of the constitution in his hands.” 
That concern may have driven many voters from marginalized castes away from the BJP because they have certain rights and protections under the constitution. Groups like the Dalits, OBCs (Other Backwards Castes), and Scheduled Tribes — typically, though not always, still part of India’s Hindu majority — had been socially oppressed and suffered from a lack of educational and job opportunities, as well as political representation. India’s democratic constitution guarantees a measure of rights and opportunities, including representation quotas in politics, for these groups. Though the BJP had previously managed to unite Hindus as a political bloc across castes with its Hindutva policies, the opposition exploitation of caste politics may have had a significant impact in UP. 
Overall, the BJP lost 63 of the seats it previously held in the Lok Sabha. That means that, although the BJP still has the most seats of any party in the lower house of parliament, it doesn’t have a majority. Together with its coalition partners, the BJP still has a 293-seat majority, but that’s not enough to make constitutional amendments unchallenged. Modi and the BJP will now encounter more friction — both from the opposition and potentially from within the coalition it formed as an insurance policy during the campaign.
The BJP campaigned in coalition with two regional secular parties, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Janata Dal (United), or JDU, forming the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) party​​. How they will govern together under Modi, however, remains to be seen.
The leadership of the TDP and JDU parties don’t see eye to eye with Modi on some fairly important issues. Nitish Kumar of the JDU party wants to conduct a caste census across the country (something the opposition INDIA coalition has also advocated for) which would give the government a better idea of how to distribute resources, programs, and political representation for marginalized castes especially. But that turn to caste politics threatens Modi’s message of cross-caste Hindu solidarity against other groups. The TDP leadership has also promised to reserve protections and rights for Muslims in the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh — something that Modi previously promised to abolish. 
That could make the NDA coalition fragile, and Modi’s desire to remain in power gives a fair amount of leverage to JDU and TDP to extract demands for their states from the central government.
“Modi now will go back to having to depend on a lot of regional partners and state parties,” Kenny said. “And the BJP, even at its height of Modi’s ability to bring in votes with charisma, was still dependent on buying the support of smaller coalitions — so being able to dispense goods, to dispense patronage, to effectively buy votes by distributing. Whether it’s things [like] rations and fuel support, and all of these kinds of things that go on in daily politics in India. That’s just come back to the fore.”
Furthermore, because there is now a fulsome opposition party, “the parliament will once again become a site for vigorous debate and contestation,” Varshney said. The BJP will not be able to push through laws as they did with recent criminal code reforms without debate.
But the opposition coalition is untested, and could become fractious over time, too, Vaishnav said. “These are parties which have been at each other’s throats, and who are highly competitive with one another in states where they have a real presence. And they’ve managed to let bygones be bygones, for the purposes of fighting this election. But when the electoral spotlight is off, will they be able to continue this method of collaboration and cooperation [having] achieved the short-term objective?”
This election, while pivotal, is far from the end of the BJP or Modi, Vaishnav said. “[Modi] is an incredibly crafty savvy marketer and politician who has an incredible amount of charisma and a reservoir of goodwill amongst the people.”
Populist and personality-driven politics are trending upward all around the world, partly because of a decline in traditional political parties and the institutions that support them, Kenny said. Modi’s just part of that wave. But this year’s election demonstrated that the trend toward populism and authoritarianism — in democratic societies, anyway — has its limits.

"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Saif Khalid,India election results: Did ‘secular’ parties let down Muslims too?,"Scared of the BJP describing them as pro-Muslim, these parties distanced themselves from the community, analysts say.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/5/india-election-results-did-secular-parties-let-down-muslims-too,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24146158031770-1717587421.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,2024-06-05T12:04:02Z,"Scared of the BJP describing them as pro-Muslim, these parties distanced themselves from the community, analysts say.
As Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi addressed journalists after election results demonstrated a dramatic setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he held up a pocket-sized version of India’s Constitution.
“It was a fight to save the constitution. I would like to thank everybody who has participated in this election. I am proud of the people who resisted the onslaught on this constitution,” Gandhi said on Tuesday evening.
“It’s the poor and marginalised people who came out to save the constitution. Workers, farmers, Dalits, adivasis [Indigenous] and backwards have helped saved this constitution.
“This constitution is the voice of the people. We stand with you and fulfil the promises.”
Missing from the list of people Gandhi thanked were India’s 200 million Muslims, the country’s largest religious minority. Muslims are believed to have overwhelmingly voted for Gandhi’s INDIA alliance, which won 232 seats in the elections for the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament — below the halfway mark of 272 but significantly more than exit polls had predicted. Modi’s BJP won 240 seats, falling short of a majority on its own and leaving it dependent on allies to form a government for the first time since Modi came to power in 2014.
Gandhi’s omission was no one-off. It was part of a pattern, say analysts, observers and many Indian Muslims – one that has seen opposition parties demonstrate seeming reluctance to even mention Muslims.
“They know that a large part of India’s [predominantly Hindu] middle class is radicalised to the extent that taking the name of Muslims might harm the fortunes of political parties,” Mohammed Ali, an award-winning journalist based in New Delhi, said, speaking of Gandhi’s Indian National Congress party and other opposition groups.
As India’s multiphase national elections drew to a close with the declaration of results, the curtains also came down on a campaign that turned increasingly vitriolic towards Muslims. Modi himself faced a warning from the Election Commission after a series of speeches that critics said represented hate speech. He referred to Muslims as “infiltrators” and “those who have more children”. And he referenced a series of Islamophobic tropes that have been widely debunked.
A Muslim youth who asked to remain anonymous said the elections were like a nightmare. “It was six weeks of nonstop anti-Muslim dog whistles. We do not feel part of this process,” he said.
Yet, through it all, many Indian Muslims say they also felt let down by the country’s so-called secular opposition parties, many of whom refused to even refer to their fears and concerns. That is reflected in a parliamentary landscape that, on its surface, appears contradictory.
The BJP with its Hindu majoritarian ideology has lost seats while avowedly secular opposition parties have gained ground. But the incoming parliament will have one of the lowest number of Muslim MPs – 24 – since independence.
 

 
The leaders of the opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) did criticise Modi for bringing religion into his campaign. But analysts and many within the Muslim community point out that the opposition largely avoided raising Muslim concerns.
Dozens of Muslims have been lynched over accusations of cow smuggling as their food choices and public prayers have come under attack from vigilantes. Governments in several BJP-ruled states have enacted laws to prevent interfaith marriage – pandering to the conspiracy theory of “love jihad”, which suggests, without evidence, that Muslim men try to marry non-Muslim women to convert them to Islam.
And in 2020, India’s capital, New Delhi, witnessed riots in which at least 53 people were killed, most of them Muslim.
The Congress party and its alliance partner the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which governs Delhi, were silent on justice for the victims of those riots during the campaign – a sore point for people like Nisar Ahmad, a resident of Mustafabad in East Delhi.
The 50-year-old ran a thriving garment business before the riots, but that was shut down due to threats from his Hindu neighbours, and he was forced to sell his house in East Delhi’s Bhagirathivihar because he was worried about his safety there after the riots.
“In the election campaign, no one cared to talk about the victims of the Delhi riots and justice for them,” Nisar told Al Jazeera.
 

 
Ahmad, who is one of the witnesses in court cases related to the Delhi riots, said he cannot forget how his neighbours were beaten, stripped and killed. “For me, everything has changed since the riots. I still feel unsafe in my own country,” he said.
“No one is talking about Muslims. The politicians fear if they use the word Muslim in their campaigns, it might hurt their vote bank,” Nisar said, referring to the opposition’s reluctance to discuss issues important to Muslims in campaign speeches. “I have voted and still hope somewhere that things might change.”
Others echoed his sentiments in Jamia Nagar, another Muslim neighbourhood in South Delhi.
“In previous elections, many politicians visited the area, and we would feel there is an election vibe,” Muhammad Shakir told Al Jazeera. This time, though, he said, “There has been no talk about our issues and local problems.
“It feels like everyone is ignoring Muslims deliberately,” he said.
Irfan Ahmed, a professor of anthropology at Ibn Haldun University in Istanbul, questioned the often touted description of India’s elections as the largest festival of democracy. “For those denied justice and dignity, it may look like the world’s biggest circus,” he said.
“Since 2014, this electoral circus has passionately been staging Muslims as a threat against which people are asked to vote,” Irfan told Al Jazeera. “While the BJP issues the threat openly, the non-BJP parties do implicitly: That is by remaining silent.”
No party, he said, “has the courage to talk about the violence done to the Muslims”.
Al Jazeera spoke to several Muslims across India who shared the same sentiment.
Experts say non-BJP parties have been reluctant to even say the word “Muslim” because the BJP has created a perception that secular parties have favoured the minority community.
“Should your hard-earned money be given to infiltrators?” Modi asked a crowd in April in the state of Rajasthan as his party alleged – without basis – that the opposition was planning to take wealth from unprivileged caste Hindus and give it to Muslims.
Guru Prakash Paswan, a spokesperson for the BJP, denied his party was against minorities. Instead, he accused the opposition of playing “divisive politics.”
“As far as the BJP is concerned, we never distinguish or discriminate on the name of religion. We follow the principles of non-discrimination guaranteed under the constitution. Like our PM says, ‘Sab ka sath, sab ka vikas, sab ka Vishwas’ [‘Everyone’s support, everyone’s development, everyone’s trust’] is our motive,” he told Al Jazeera.
But the reality feels very different for many Indian Muslims. And it is not just the BJP that they blame.
Parties belonging to the INDIA alliance gave fewer tickets to Muslim candidates this time than they did in 2019 at a time when Muslim representation in parliament was already at its lowest since independence in 1947.
Non-BJP parties gave 115 tickets to Muslims in 2019, but the newly formed INDIA alliance fielded only 78 Muslims this year. The Lok Sabha has 543 seats.
In Maharashtra state with a population of 10 million Muslims, non-BJP parties did not give a single ticket to Muslims while in Uttar Pradesh state, home to 40 million Muslims, the state’s main opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) fielded just four Muslims. The SP has long counted Muslims among its core voters.
The Bahujan Samaj Party, a pro-Dalit party, fielded 35 Muslims across India, including 17 in Uttar Pradesh.
In Bihar state, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, part of the INDIA alliance, gave tickets to two Muslims. The state has 20 million Muslims while four out of 20 of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidates in Kerala were Muslims. One-fourth of the state’s population is Muslim.
The Trinamool Congress party, which governs West Bengal state in eastern India, fielded six Muslims, including five in West Bengal. One-third of the state’s nearly 100 people are Muslims.
Most of Muslims won from constituencies with substantial Muslim populations.
Historically, Muslim representation in the legislature has been low, but it has declined since the rise of the BJP in the 1990s. In the outgoing parliament, 27 MPs were Muslims.
“Addressing the question of representation is a bit complicated in a country which has one of the largest clusters of billionaires while at the same time is home to the largest numbers of poor people in the world,” said a professor of political science at New Delhi-based Jamia Millia Islamia University who wished to remain anonymous.
“You have economically and socially marginalized groups vying for the limited resources, so giving any concession to one group faces resistance from other vulnerable social groups,” he told Al Jazeera.
“And it was this fear that the BJP exploited by hammering out the message that the Congress party was planning to snatch reservations from unprivileged caste Hindus and give them to Muslims.”
The BJP fielded just one Muslim candidate this year, and none of its 302 members in the outgoing parliament is Muslim.
Paswan, the BJP spokesman, defended his party, saying it works for all communities.
The BJP party has done “unparalleled welfare work for minority communities” in the past 10 years, he told Al Jazeera. He said the party has nominated Muslims to the upper house of parliament.
Experts say non-BJP parties avoid giving many tickets to Muslims to avert a consolidation of Hindu voters behind the BJP. All of that underscores a deeper issue with the way so-called secular parties view Muslims, Professor Irfan said: only as voters, not as leaders.
While the INDIA alliance has been cool towards Muslim parties such as the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), based in the southern city of Hyderabad, and the All India United Democratic party, based in the northeastern state of Assam, it has not hesitated to include outright Hindu parties.
The Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), based in Maharashtra, is led by the son of Balasaheb Thackeray, who was accused – though never formally charged – with instigating anti-Muslim violence in Mumbai in the early 1990s. Today, the party is a part of the INDIA alliance although it still has a Hindu majoritarian agenda.
Shama Mohamed, a Congress spokesperson, defended the party’s stand on minorities.
“We will ensure that the minorities receive their fair share of opportunities in education, healthcare, public employment, public works contracts, skill development, sports and cultural activities without discrimination.
“We will respect and uphold the fundamental right to practise one’s faith and the rights guaranteed to religious minorities under … the constitution.”
An analysis of the manifesto of the Congress party, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Trinamool Congress party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Communist Party of India (Marxist) – all major opposition parties – shows that most of them did not use the word Muslim and stayed away from issues facing the community.
The Samajwadi Party coined a new catchline for the campaign: Pichhda, Dalit and Alpasankhyak (Backward, Dalit and minorities) in an attempt to get rid of its pro-Muslim image.
The party manifesto as well as the speeches of its top leader, Akhilesh Yadav, steered clear of topics concerning Muslims such as extrajudicial killings and the use of bulldozers to demolish Muslim homes and businesses.
In neighbouring Bihar state, the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal party also tried to change its pro-Muslim image. It coined a new catchphrase to expand its base beyond the Muslim and Yadavs, an unprivileged caste Hindu group. The party’s main leader, Tejasvi Yadav, tried to underplay the Muslim connection, pointing out that his party stood for all young people in one of the poorest states in India. Youth employment was his biggest election focus.
 

 
The Congress party, which leads the INDIA alliance, also avoided using the word Muslim in its manifesto. Its focus has been social equity and representation of unprivileged caste Hindus in jobs and other government institutions.
In 2018, former party leader Sonia Gandhi said Congress needed to shed the notion that it was a pro-Muslim party.
In its manifesto, the party also did not mention the government’s repeal under Modi of Indian-administered Kashmir’s semiautonomous status in 2019 and stayed silent about attacks against Muslims.
Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party launched a website AAPKaRamRajya.com before the elections to showcase its work – in effect mirroring the BJP’s longstanding promise to turn India, officially a secular nation, into Ram Rajya (kingdom of Lord Ram).
In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress party promised in its manifesto to abolish a citizenship law that was enacted in 2019 and that many critics say discriminates against Muslims. The Trinamool Congress also committed to not implementing a uniform civil code, a policy pushed by the BJP that would end personal laws that allow Muslims and other communities to follow their traditional customs and practices when it comes to marriage inheritance and other civil matters. Still, the party manifesto did not mention the word “Muslim”.
Analysts say the BJP’s Hindu majoritarian push has made Muslim issues disappear from public discourse.
Mohammad Reyaz, an assistant professor at Aliah University in the eastern city of Kolkata, said the silence of so-called secular parties on Muslims, while disappointing, is not surprising – in part because they knew the community would not vote for the BJP in any case.
“Muslims will still vote for secular parties despite their marginalization. They have little choice available,” Mohammad said.
To be sure, not all political parties have been silent.
The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), which governs the southern state of Tamil Nadu, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM), which has been in power in neighbouring Kerala since 2016, mentioned Muslims in their manifestos.
The DMK promised to repeal the contentious citizenship law and grant job reservations to Muslims. The party also criticised the revocation of Kashmir’s special status. The CPM is also committed to restoring Kashmir’s special status, Mariam Alexander Baby, a party leader, said.
The CPM’s manifesto specifically talked about attacks against Muslims and promised to ban vigilante groups. It talked about compensation to Muslims who have been wrongfully jailed under a series of laws, including “anti-terror” laws.
But what about other parties?
Irfan, who is also the author of The Algebra of Warfare-Welfare, which analysed the 2014 elections, said that at the end of the day, many parties use language similar to that of the BJP.
“Rahul Gandhi, the so-called secular leader of the Congress party, eloquently speaks about Dalits, adivasis and so on, but he lacks the courage to even mention the word Muslim, let alone highlight their plight demonstrated by many research and reports,” Irfan said.
“In that sense, the difference between Gandhi and Modi is only technical. Both favour an ethnic populist democracy though their respective styles are not identical.”

In the capital's polarized constituency of northeast Delhi, DW delves into campaigns, promises and what locals are looking for in a leader.
Northeast Delhi is set for an electoral showdown on May 25 between Manoj Tiwari from India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Kanhaiya Kumar from the Indian National Congress (INC). 
The capital's newest constituency is largely underdeveloped, comprised of resettlement colonies built in the late 1970s and home to large sections of migrant laborers.
Around 30% of northeast Delhi's residents are Muslim; the rest are Hindu. Its issues are a reflection of India's larger problems of inequality, unemployment and growing communal disharmony.
The lines of religious divide are evident in the region, and sectarian tensions have worsened since a communal riot in 2020 killed over 30 people.

In Raja Market, a distinctly Muslim neighborhood, locals emphasized that education, safety and livelihood are some of the area's main issues.
""Nothing good has happened here,"" 24-year-old shopkeeper Mohammad Tariq told DW. ""Bloodshed is common. People get stabbed over little disagreements. Even kids go to school with knives and blades,"" Tariq said.
Women's safety is another issue amid regular reports of sexual assaults in northeast Delhi.
Malti Tiwari, who lives close to Raja Market, said women's safety has remained a problem under several governments. ""Where is it safe for women?"" she questioned but declined to elaborate.
""We haven't seen Manoj Tiwari here in the last 10 years,"" said Mohammed Farhan, another shopkeeper, claiming the BJP MP only visits the constituency's Hindu-dominated areas. ""Kanhaiya Kumar is a new candidate. He is well-educated. We want change. We want a new face.""
Others, like 80-year-old Khurshid, said that, since the riot, both communities have viewed the other with suspicion.
""No work has happened in the area since the BJP came to power,"" said Khurshid, who has been living in the constituency since 1975, adding that now, ""it's very difficult for Muslims here to step out alone.""
""We will say it clearly that we'll vote for Congress. We'll get Congress.""

In northeast Delhi's Hindu-dominated Shahdara locality, locals with whom DW spoke were largely satisfied with the BJP's Tiwari.
""We have all the facilities available to us. What don't we have?"" said pan shop owner Uday Raj Chauhan.
""The truth of the matter is that Manoj Tiwari belongs from here, lives here,"" said the 44-year-old who voted for the BJP in the last three Lok Sabha elections. ""A few months ago, a house nearby caved in, and some people died. He himself came to check on the family three days after the incident.""
Uber driver Shivlochan Prasad insisted that inflation and unemployment were not the current government's fault.
""When there are more people, there will be higher prices. There will be more unemployed people. What can the government do about this?"" he said, adding that Tiwari's government deserved continuity.
Kanhaiya Kumar shot to fame in 2016 after delivering a speech about freedom from corruption, hunger and discrimination to a packed auditorium in New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.
Kumar believes that the current government has polarized the masses across India and in his constituency.
""Hindu-Muslim divide is the easiest way for the media to describe today's politics, but it isn't the full picture,"" Kumar said. ""The social fabric is affected when there is an economic conflict, and we have been looking at these things as a separate issue.""
""Outsider agents were brought in so that the poor Muslims and Hindus of the region do not sit together and figure out the reason behind the lack of development in the last 10 years,"" Kumar said.
Kumar's campaign has been plagued with delays, defections and even an in-party protest by workers against his nomination because he is an ""outsider.""
The protests died down after Kumar formally submitted his nomination with the Election Commission.
When asked about the chaos within the Congress party and the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) it heads, Kumar said that politicians who did not feel pressured to lead change from their vote base had defected to the ruling party to avoid ""inconvenience.""
He further claimed that defections would not change the outcome by much.
""I can see for the first time that parties are not fighting the elections; the public is. I can tell you this as a candidate,"" Kumar said. ""They know what they want to vote for. A lot has changed during these elections.""
Singer and actor-turned-politician Manoj Tiwari is a popular face of India's regional Bhojpuri cinema.
The BJP leader first emerged victorious in northeast Delhi in 2014, in the elections that saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi coming to power.
Tiwari also won from the constituency in 2019 and is the only sitting BJP MP in Delhi to retain his seat as the party in the national capital fields fresh faces this year.
""The 2024 Lok Sabha election is an election for the future of the country. On one side is Narendra Modi, who raised the honor of the soldiers of the country … gave free treatment up to 5 lakh rupees [around $6,000, €5,500] to more than 55 crore [550 million] people of the country,"" Tiwari said at one of his public meetings in northeast Delhi.
""On the other side is the Congress and INDIA alliance, which works to promote corruption, appeasement and anti-national forces.""
Tiwari called his opponent Kumar a ""40-day tourist."" He has also accused Congress of ignoring northeast Delhi and last week accused the opposition party of being involved in "" appeasement"" politics, in line with the BJP's national stance towards the opposition.
""Immersed in vote bank and appeasement, the Congress is determined to insult the Constitution, making reservations on the basis of religion, which we have to be cautious about,"" he said.
DW's repeated attempts to arrange an interview with Tiwari for this article remained unsuccessful.
Election fever in the capital has reached its peak, with locals vocally debating the pros and cons of their choices. But there's another section of society that is disillusioned.
Mueedin, who owns a bike repair shop three buildings away from Kumar's election office, has witnessed the rallies and speeches in the run-up to elections daily. The patriarch of a joint family with over 50 members, he said it does not matter whom they vote for.
""We have lived here all our lives. We have seen different governments come and go. They're all the same,"" the 62-year-old told DW.
""The road shows and promises are not new, they happen every five years. After the vote, things will go back to normal, and nothing will change.""

"{'id': 'rt', 'name': 'RT'}",RT,"Like My Reel, Vote My Party: The world’s biggest election is being dominated by the local Instagram stars","India’s ruling party relied on Facebook in 2014, WhatsApp in 2019 but, in 2024, it’s all Instareels with small-town, hyper-localized appeal Read Full Article at RT.com",https://www.rt.com/india/597401-india-election-insta-influencers/,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/66406b9b85f54006c51f19c5.jpg,2024-05-12T07:46:33Z,"Neil Shakya, 25, is an Instagram influencer from India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. An aspiring police officer from a tier-III city, his Instareels proudly boast his Hindu identity to his 353,000 followers throughout the state – and do so due to a lucrative deal with a non-party person who wishes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to return to power in the ongoing national election.
What is new in the messaging by Neil and others like him is that the BJP earlier relied on effective messaging through Facebook in 2014 and on WhatsApp in 2019. In 2024, the party –and its opponents – are relying on decentralized messaging, through ‘micro-influencers’ from small towns using Instagram and YouTube – both highly popular with youth and first-time voters.
The independent polling body the Election Commission of India (ECI) says there are 18.2 million first-time voters on its electoral rolls. Voters aged between 18 and 29 number over 197 million, including 20 million new voters in the age group.
India is the biggest market for Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook, all owned by Meta, with 229 million, 535 million and 315 million users respectively. Google-owned YouTube has 462 million users in India. Statista says India’s influencer market will grow by over $300 million by 2025.
And, according to SS, a social-media manager demanding anonymity for this story, whereas WhatsApp is associated with negative messaging, Instareels are positive by their very nature, especially those by young women.
A way to make decent money
For instance, Neil Shakya has a separate Instagram page dedicated to his hometown, with 90,000 followers, that has also been monetized for political campaigns.
“I heard about this business model from other influencers around the country,” Shakya told RT. “I told the middle-man my rates and they agreed. These are random people without a designation in political parties, and sometimes they are from little-known social media agencies. They pay in cash when the work is done.”
“It is a sweet deal for young people like me who are still preparing for a job. Although it is full time, we make decent money.”
Manish Kumar runs a social-media agency in Bihar, India’s poorest state. He claims to manage the social-media accounts of over 15 politicians contesting the ongoing election to the national parliament’s lower house, the Lok Sabha.
“There is huge demand for social media influencers, especially girls under 25 with a large fan base, especially on Instagram. Leaders now know where India’s youth is spending most of its time. The demand for making ‘reels’ that are politically aligned has gone up, and influencers charge according to the number of their followers,” Manish tells RT.
“Another important aspect of this form of political campaign is that work comes from a party supporter and not from the party so the funds spent are not counted in the budget of either the candidate or their party, and does not violate the Election Commission’s spending limits,” he says. “These campaigns continue even after the [commission’s] campaigning deadline.”
Apoorva Tripathi, 25, has an enviable 67,000 followers on Instagram. From Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, her online influence began by promoting Punjabi music. Little did she know that her digital prowess would catch the attention of the political machinery.
“In February a major opposition party proposed a collaboration to promote their agenda on my handle,” Apoorva recalls. “The offer was financially enticing but I had to decline because neither my family nor I align with that party’s ideologies.”
She will promote a political campaign if she gets the right deal. “I am young and also studying, which is why I am not stressing hard to get a deal,” she says. “Also, I have a lot of work at the moment.”
A survey by Lokniti-CSDS (Centre for Studies of Developing Societies), a think tank, says 27% of the 10,000 voters (across 19 of 28 states) cited unemployment as their primary concern. Though India is the world’s fastest-growing major economy, 62% surveyed said finding jobs had become more difficult in the last five years.
The landscape of political advertising has undergone a seismic shift, according to Santosh Sharma, 34, an advertising executive and political liaison in Lucknow. Gone are the days when parties heavily relied on traditional media like pamphlets, hoardings, and print advertisements. The real battleground is digital – specifically Instagram and its burgeoning influencer ecosystem.
“Every political party today wants to engage micro-influencers in each district,” Sharma explains. “The Indian audience is spending significant time-consuming Instagram ‘Reels’ and other short-form content.”
These micro-influencers, with their localized appeal and dedicated following, have proven instrumental in creating a tangible impact on potential voters.
Sharma cites the example of Navratan Yadav, a 12-year-old influencer who, despite his tender age and lack of political awareness is most sought-after by the state’s Samajwadi Party. ”Navratan is paid well because he has a substantial following on Instagram, is well-liked, and his content goes viral,” Sharma says.EditDelete
A post shared by Robin Yadav (@itz__x__robin__786)
This transition from print to radio and television and now to micro-influencers signifies the future of political marketing. “Micro-influencer marketing is the future,” Sharma asserts confidently.
“Micro-influencers offer a cost-effective alternative to traditional advertising media, allowing parties to maximize their outreach while optimizing their marketing budget,” Sharma says. “With relatable personalities, personal connection and hyper-localized appeal, these influencers can effectively disseminate party messaging and sway public opinion in a way that resonates with target voters in their respective communities.”
SS (real name hidden on request) is a social-media vendor mostly into mass WhatsApp messaging and paid Twitter/X trends. “WhatsApp is basically used to spread misinformation and we as a vendor have not witnessed much demand for mass messaging through WhatsApp,” he tells RT. “This time people are approaching us for Instagram influencers because Instareels have a larger audience.”
There has been a decline in demand. “Over 60% of the market is now captured by Instagram and a tiny portion left with X,” SS says. “X’s frequent algorithm changes has made it difficult, and this is a reason political parties want to go with micro-influencers on Instagram.”
SS adds that micro-influencers have hiked their rates as demand grows. They now charge at least 30% compared to their per-Instareel rates in December.
“Earlier, politicians or parties would be in touch with journalists or media organizations, print, electronic and digital, to get their voices across to common people,” says Bharat Nayak, independent fact checker and media literacy trainer. “However, with the increasing influence and reach of influencers, politicians are comfortable giving interviews to them, especially in India. Influencers ask comfortable and public-relations related questions, typically avoiding interrogative or challenging ones, helping politicians create a positive image.”
There is another benefit. “When politicians or parties promote content in print or digital media, it’s typically disclosed if it’s paid content,” Nayak says. “However, influencers often don’t reveal if their content is paid for, leading to potential bias.”
For example, influencers are invited to government functions and videos from these events are promoted on social media without mentioning the relationship. “This trend has become common in India, especially during the approach of elections, with political parties using influencers to highlight their work or propagate their messages at a relatively low cost,” says Nayak.
Expressing concern, Dr Tanu Dang, associate professor at Delhi’s Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, says there should be a mechanism to check the political content being generated in ‘Stories and Reels’ on social media.
“Roping in social media influencers for effective marketing has become the norm for most brands,” she says. “Now even political parties have started leveraging the online presence and reach of influencers by engaging them in campaigns. Influencers are generating substantial income by endorsing political messages and sharing political content. However, the absence of mechanisms to check the authenticity of the information remains a cause of concern as they have the virtual power to influence public opinion.”
The Election Commission of India lacks special strategies or mechanisms to keep a check on social media. They can only check possible violations of the Model Code of Conduct through complaints received through tagging by users.

"{'id': 'rt', 'name': 'RT'}",RT,"Eat, pray, vote: How women are being lured to take part in India’s election amid low turnout","To combat voter apathy and a scorching summer, civil society groups in India are working hard to increase women’s turnout Read Full Article at RT.com",https://www.rt.com/india/598098-indian-women-vote-election/,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/664f2cd520302761d94b1ebb.jpg,2024-05-24T02:50:21Z,"May 13 marked the fourth phase of India’s Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) election, which will determine whether or not Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets a third term. It was also polling day in Jalgaon, an agro-industrial city in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. 
The official Instagram page of Womeniya, an all-female community of entrepreneurs, was flooded with messages, photos, and selfies of women posing outside Jalgaon’s polling stations, some in large groups, flashing their inked fingers, with pouts to match. One message was from a young mother who had decided to leave her eight-month-old with family members for an hour while she enjoyed polling-day revelry with girlfriends.

Womeniya’s advocacy for higher participation by women voters was one of several dozen initiatives by civil society, mirroring the efforts by district officials and the Election Commission Of India (ECI) to improve the turnout of the country’s 969 million voters in its second longest ever election (India's first election in 1951 was a mammoth and unprecedented exercise) – during a scorching summer where temperatures crossed the 45-degree Celsius mark in several regions.
Other notable efforts included a mini marathon christened a ‘democracy run’ in the southern metropolis of Hyderabad, and a free ice-cream for voters in Hubballi, in the south Indian state of Karnataka.
The ECI itself, after the second round of polling, redoubled its efforts to boost voter turnouts, and liaised with civil society groups, traders’ bodies, and others to coax people into casting their vote.
In three major towns of central Indian state Madhya Pradesh, bus operators offered free rides for those who displayed an inked finger. There was also a lucky draw for voters, organied by a trade body. In the southern Indian state of Karnataka, the ECI set up ‘sakhi booths’ that had all-women polling personnel, and ‘green’ polling booths bearing messages on climate change. Rotary Clubs and other groups were roped in across urban India.
The election’s fifth phase was held on May 20 (the seventh and final phase is on June 1). The slightly lower turnouts in comparison to the 2019 election, particularly during the first two phases of polling, rattled the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in recent weeks, prompting fresh exhortations to voters by officials and Hindu nationalist groups. At least some of the lackluster polling numbers were interpreted as fatigue among the BJP’s voters. 
According to the latest data from the ECI, the overall turnout in the first four phases of polling was 66.95% of registered voters, promoted a little by the 69.16% turnout in the fourth phase, and almost as much as the overall turnout of 67.47% in the 2019 election. The fifth phase, coinciding with an intense heat wave in parts of India, recorded a dip once again with an overall voter turnout of 57%. The state of Maharashtra witnessed the lowest turnout at 48.88%, with the main opposition party accusing ECI officials of causing intentional delays and long queues outside polling stations that discouraged voters.     
Low turnout has been a persistent election-time vexation in India. Urban and upper-crust boroughs have often displayed apathy and disinterest, while tens of millions of domestic migrants in the country find it untenable to travel to native districts to cast their ballot.
Historically, about a third of registered voters do not cast their vote during elections in India, a fact that is symptomatic as much of working class people’s inability to take time off work as it reflects a mistrust of the political process.  
For decades, Indian women lagged behind male voters in overall turnouts, a gap that was finally bridged in the 2019 general election.
“Many women are hesitant to vote,” said Pooja Mundhra, a chartered accountant who runs Womeniya, a community of nearly 25,000 women entrepreneurs and small business owners that organises online and offline meet-ups, events and educational workshops to help women grow their businesses. “Women often don’t know the polling procedure, and my platform tells them how easy it is.”
She said the message women found most resonant was that polling day was an opportunity to express their opinions on things that affect them.
Along with a little assistance from Jalgaon district collector Ayush Prasad, Womeniya announced contests for polling day. Mundhra said they urged women in Jalgaon to dress “as fancy as they can” when they go to vote, and post on social media photos of their inked fingers and their experiences of voting day. Prizes, sponsored by Womeniya entrepreneurs, were given for the largest group of women who turned the exercise of their franchise into a group outing, for best attire, and so on.   
Mundhra, a digital marketing maven in Jalgaon, said the response was tremendous.  
Anisha Ravi Talreja, who runs Roorash, a nail art studio in Jalgaon that customizes gel press-on nails for women, offered her DIY kit as contest gifts, stick-and-go nails that are reusable up to five times. “Not only very young people, even women in their 30s and 40s have joined the nail art trend, and this was a cool way to encourage women to vote,” Talreja said. 
Prasad, the district collector, said the registration of eligible women as voters was itself low to start with. In Jalgaon district, in August 2023, there were only 16,000 women voters in the 18-20 age group. “Our seven-point program to improve turnouts began with ensuring better registration of eligible voters,” Prasad said. Nearly 40,000 young women were registered as voters before the polls.  
A widespread problem in rural areas was women’s unfamiliarity with technology and the electronic voting machine. Seen alongside women’s inclination to participate in activities as a group, the district administration decided to promote voting day as a social event, particularly for women. 
In addition to the Womeniya initiative and other measures such as drinking water facilities at polling booths, Prasad also featured in an educational video about the process of voting in which he was pictured chatting with the women staffers of a much-loved local eatery in Jalgaon. Donning a hairnet in the blisteringly hot kitchen of the Krishnaji Bharit restaurant, Prasad gamely compared the various stages of the polling process with the various stages of meal-prep, cooking and serving. The video went viral, clocking hundreds of thousands of views and downloads over a couple of weeks.
How successful were Jalgoan’s efforts? While overall turnout in the fourth phase went up to 69%, only a couple of percentage points over the previous round, in Jalgaon city, voting percentage improved by 11.57% over the 2019 numbers. Jalgaon district recorded an improvement of nearly 8% over 2019.

In another initiative, for six months running up to the election, a small team of volunteers working remotely from home-offices in Mumbai, Pune, and Karnataka took a different approach to making the world’s largest electoral exercise a participatory one, pursuing the idea of a truly engaged citizenry.
The Informed Voter Project released four reports from April onwards, aimed at “decimating guesswork in the political decision-making process,” according to Vivek Gilani, founding-trustee of the Informed Voter Project. These reports assessed the performance of the incumbent government against promises in the BJP’s manifesto in 2019, with a detailed analysis of nearly 98 manifesto promises pertaining to agriculture, environment, labor, human resource development, women and child development, public grievances and pensions, and health and family welfare.
The reports also analyzed the annual growth of candidates’ wealth in comparison with the average growth rate of wealth for the ordinary Indian, as well as criminal records of candidates. 
 “Unlike the ‘get out the vote’ and other sporadic civic campaigns, we use conventional and digital outreach resources to focus on just the ‘swing voters’ who seek rigorous and reliable information about candidates,” said Gilani. “This efficiently mitigates apathy amongst voters.”
“Indifference is not good for democracy,” Modi recently said during a television interview, when asked about lower turnouts. Nearly 297 million eligible voters failed to exercise their franchise in the 2019 election, a figure that is unlikely to change dramatically despite many heartening civil society efforts.

In a major setback to the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress is set to increase its seats in the state to 29 in the fiercely-contested LoK Sabha elections. 
Despite the prediction of most of the exit polls that the BJP would get more seats than the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state, the saffron party has bagged a lesser number of seats in the 2024 LS elections than 2019 elections. It has been able to pocket only 12 seats, according to the Election Commission, till the time of reporting. 
In the 2019 elections, the BJP had secured 18 seats with 40.64 per cent vote share, while Trinamool had bagged 22 seats with 43.69 per cent vote share. 
As per the latest Election Commission figures, the Trinamool Congress won in 19 seats and was leading in 10 seats. The BJP won 3 seats and was ahead in 9 seats. The Congress won in only one constituency. 
Last time, the Congress had won two seats. The Left did not get a single seat. 
The parliamentary elections for the 42 constituencies in West Bengal held in seven phases from April 19 to June 1. 
After an intense and polarising campaign, the TMC has made a major comeback and gave a big jolt to the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During poll campaigns, Modi had exuded confidence that his party would emerge as the biggest gainer in the state. 
The BJP has been able to retain only three seats-- Darjeeling, Alipurduars and Jalpaiguri -- in North Bengal this time. TMC has been able to wrest Cooch Behar seat from incumbent BJP MP and Union Minister Pramanik Nisith Pramanik, who has lost by over 39,000 votes. Trinamool has also won Raiganj. Notably, North Bengal was considered a stronghold of the saffron party. 
BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar, who was trailing earlier in the day, was leading by a thin margin of over 9600 votes from the Balurghat LS constituency in North Bengal, according to the Election Commission, till the time of reporting. 
Dilip Ghosh, former state president of the saffron party, lost the Bardhaman-Durgapur seat, from where Trinamool Congress candidate and former cricket player Kirti Azad won by a margin of 1.38 lakh votes. 
In a major jolt, BJP candidate Rekha Patra lost by over 4.7 lakh votes from Basirhat constituency, where TMC’s SK Nurul Islam won. Notably, Sandeshkhali falls under the Basirhat LS constituency. 
Sandeshkhali, a small island in the Sundarban delta in Bengal’s North 24-Parganas district, has emerged as an epicentre of a major political storm for the last five months with allegations and counter-allegations between the Trinamool and the BJP heating up the scene. In the alleged violence and sexual harassment against women, a controversial TMC leader is the main accused. 
The BJP fielded Patra, one of the alleged victims of the violence, from the seat to take on Islam. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had applauded Patra as “Shakti Swaroopa” (the image of courage). 
BJP candidate and former Calcutta High Court judge Abhijit Gagopadhyay was leading from Tamluk constituency in South Bengal by over 77,000 votes. 
TMC national general secretary and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew 
Abhishek Banerjee, who was seeking re-election from the Diamond Harbour LS seat in South 24 Parganas district, won by a whopping margin of 7.11 lakh votes. 
Trinamool Congress’ firebrand leader Mahua Moitra, who contested from Krishnanagar seat against BJP’s Amrita Roy, won by a margin of 56,705 votes, according to the Election Commission’s figure. 
Parliament expelled the former investment banker in December last year, accusing her of taking bribes in exchange for asking questions. Moitra denied the allegations, and said she was expelled “without proof”. 
“They (BJP) have committed major atrocities against us in the last ten years. The CBI, ED, Income Tax, BJP’s Home Ministry-- all were unleashed. When I saw the exit polls results, I asked myself am I losing confidence? I have been on the streets for two months. I did not see the exit polls reflected in the eyes of the people,” Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee told the media here on Tuesday. 
Banerjee expressed her satisfaction with the BJP not getting a simple majority in the Lok Sabha polls. “There is no clear majority for BJP. Modi did not get the single largest majority, he should resign, and so should Amit Shah on moral grounds after today’s results,” she said, extending her support for the INDIA bloc. 
“TMC won in Sandeshkhali where propaganda was done,” she added. 
According to political analysts, the support of minority voters and direct beneficiaries of the state government’s social schemes like Lakshmir Bhandar has played a big role in TMC’s major win. 
“Around one-third of the population in West Bengal are not with the BJP. One out of three persons in the state is of the Muslim community in the state, and they are not with the saffron party. And, also over two crore people are the beneficiaries of Lakshmir Bhandar scheme. These women are getting monthly direct benefits from the state government. These two major factors have played a major role in favouring TMC to defeat the BJP,” said political analyst Sabyasachi Basu Ray Chaudhury. 
The Lakshmir Bhandar scheme, introduced in 2021 by the Mamata Banerjee government, provides cash assistance to women between 25 and 60 years. The cash assistance initially had been ₹500 for the general category, and later it was increased to ₹1,000. 
In a major jolt to the Congress in Bengal, state Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury lost from Baharampur Lok Sabha constituency in Murshidabad district in South Bengal. Trinamool candidate and former cricketer Yusuf Pathan won with a margin of over 85,000 votes from this seat.

      The outcome of India’s election was quite singular, compared with 2014 and 2019. All major parties celebrated it. The NDA was happy because it returned to power, the Congress and INDIA were happy that they did better than in the past, while regional parties were pleased they came out stronger in their states. This is what in economics would be close to a ‘Pareto optimal’ situation, where everyone is better off and no one worse off.

     
      All through election season, one could see several concepts of economics at play. The most startling was the ‘irrational exuberance’ witnessed on 3 June when the Sensex closed at a peak of 76,468 on the back of exit polls on 1 June which indicated a huge mandate for the ruling establishment. 

     
      The premise was that a landslide majority of 350-360 Lok Sabha seats for the NDA would accelerate economic reforms, thus reviving the Keynesian ‘animal spirits’ of industry. When the results on 4 June revealed a majority for the NDA (though not for the BJP), the market index crashed to 72,079 amid worries that reforms would slow down. 

Also read: Are behavioural nudges overrated or just badly designed?In market parlance, stocks tend to ‘revert to the mean,’ and not surprisingly, on 5 June, the Sensex closed at 74,382, which was higher than its closing level on 31 May.

     
      The exit polls were another exercise that saw economic laws prevail. These polls went wrong in the last Lok Sabha election, as well as during recent state assembly polls. Hence, this time, all of them seem to have followed a policy of ‘adaptive expectations,’ by which the last outcome is simply scaled up in an effort by pollsters to look good. 

     
      Such expectations are considered safe because we learn from the past and assume that the present will carry on in the future. But exit polls went wrong again, like GDP forecasts (no analyst projected 8.2% growth for 2023-24).

     
      The last two elections, in 2014 and 2019, had resulted in what would be called a ‘monopoly’ in economics. A single-party Lok Sabha majority results in monopoly power that can be wielded in every field. A coalition this time means that there would be more of an ‘oligopolistic’ structure, so we can expect some checks and balances, as every partner would have a unique strategy. 

     
      This is where ‘game theory’ comes into play, with each party trying to maximize its gains by guessing the response of the other. These dynamics are likely to prevail even after the new coalition government takes charge.

     
      If one goes back to this year’s election campaigns, including manifestoes, promises of monetary benefits formed a common theme. These included cash transfers, apart from free power, bus rides, etc. What has been brewing for long in election seasons is the creation of a ‘moral hazard’ by so-called freebies. The hazard is that once implemented, handouts will be hard to withdraw, as it would antagonize beneficiaries who may vote for the opposition.

So the micro picture matters more than the macro.

     
      Elections, however, present a market that is better than goods and money markets in terms of what economists would call ‘information asymmetry.’ Every party is eager to give out all the information needed to attract voters. This could be in the form of what has been done or what will be delivered if elected to power. With symmetric information available to all participants, this is largely an efficient market. Most economic markets are not.

     
      A major part of election campaigns is centred on making the right noises. These are what are called ‘announcement effects.’ Just as regulators in the financial sector are thought capable of moving markets by just making announcements (talking them up or down, i.e.), voting patterns are mostly driven by political announcements. 

     
      They are credible because if parties renege on them, they would face the wrath of the market (or voters) the next time round. A plethora of announcements are made by all parties to send the electorate the right ‘signals,’ a term used by George Akerlof, who espoused a theory of signalling in the market for second-hand cars (or ‘lemons’).

     
      The outcome patterns of election results are also interesting. There are several constituencies and states that continue to vote en masse for the same party. Here, the theoretical concepts of Veblen and Giffen goods come in. The former refers to a luxury good for which one is willing to pay a higher price, even if just for social appearances.

      Behavioural economics has taught us that many decisions taken are based on psychology, which can be influenced by marketers, including politicians. On a lighter yet ironical note, the final results have not entirely been Pareto optimal. They were bad for India’s Left parties, which face the threat of ‘withering away,’ as Friedrich Engels prophesied of the state under communism.

With less than two weeks to go before election results are announced, the picture is looking less certain for the popular leader.
Party insiders, opposition members and analysts who have traveled across the country to speak to voters say there’s little evidence of a “Modi wave” that allowed his Bharatiya Janata Party to sweep the polls in 2019. Then, the BJP won 303 of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha. Along with its allies, the BJP-led coalition had about 351 seats.
Modi targeted more than 400 seats for his coalition this time around, a goal emblazoned on campaign posters and one the prime minister frequently plugged in his campaign speeches. But a notable shift in Modi’s tone after the first phase of voting — where he began using divisive, anti-Muslim language and ramped up attacks against the main opposition group’s welfare policies — fueled speculation the BJP may have been spooked by early voting trends and needed to fire up its support base.
Election rules don’t allow for any result polls to be published during the six weeks of voting, so it’s difficult to know with any certainty whether the BJP’s support has indeed declined. India’s first-past-the-post electoral system means even small margins can decide the winner. Exit polls won’t be published until June 1 with results expected on June 4.
Muddying the waters even further is the fact that both the ruling party and opposition are claiming publicly they have the upper hand. Modi himself told The Economic Times this week that the BJP has already won a majority of the seats in the parliament based on voting in the first five phases of elections so far.
However, behind closed doors a picture is emerging of an opposition alliance that’s slightly more optimistic about their likely gains, and a ruling party that appears to be bracing for some losses. The Indian National Congress, the main opposition group, expects to win between 90-110 seats in total, up from 52 in 2019, according to a senior party leader, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The estimates were based on internal polling, the person said.
Three BJP officials from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana states privately admitted that the party is unlikely to match its 2019 figures, although they still expect to win a majority of the seats in parliament. The officials asked not to be identified in order to speak freely about internal matters.
Nalin Kohli, a spokesman for the BJP, said there’s no reason why the ruling party and its allies won’t significantly increase their results from five years ago given the performance of the Modi government and his leadership. Congress party spokespeople weren’t immediately available to comment when contacted for further information.
Uncertainty about the poll outcome has already seeped into financial markets, with volatility rising in recent weeks. The India VIX Index — a gauge of likely market swings over the next 30 days — more than doubled from a low in April.
Foreigners pulled $3.5 billion from local shares in May, although there are now signs of global funds ending their bearish view. Indian equities hit a record on Thursday after the central bank’s generous dividend to the government and Modi’s comments to The Economic Times of an expected “historic mandate.”
Majority Mark
Political analysts and economists are less optimistic.
Rahul Verma, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, a New Delhi-based think tank, expects the BJP to stay in power, while winning anywhere between 282 to 310 seats nationally. Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at TS Lombard, was more bearish, saying anecdotal evidence during her recent travels from India’s east to west coast suggests the BJP could possibly fall below the majority mark of 272 seats. With the help of its allies, though, the party will still be able to form the government, she said in a report on May 16.
Reasons for the BJP’s slide in support are varied, according to party officials and analysts. Modi has been in power for a decade and has delivered on several of the BJP’s key pledges, a key one being the building of a temple in honor of the Hindu god Ram on a site where an ancient mosque once stood. The inauguration of the temple in Ayodhya in January fulfilled a key promise made to the BJP’s Hindu nationalist base for decades.
“Anecdotal evidence from our travels on the election trail from India’s east coast to its west suggests that Modi’s popularity has waned somewhat since the Ram temple inauguration in January, when a BJP wave seemed to have swept across India,” Deveshwar said. “Although multiple factors at play in a country as vast as India make the national mood difficult to read, common themes we picked up on the road include the lack of job creation and rising demand for welfare schemes.”
Beyond those, voters’ concerns have been dominated by the high cost of living and caste identity, observers say. The opposition’s heavy focus on improving the welfare of the poor, especially those who belong to the lowest social groups, have resonated with voters, they say.
Modi’s 400-seat target may have been counter-productive, too, since it might have led to complacency in the BJP’s ranks while fueling a belief among lower-caste voters that the BJP will use its parliamentary super-majority to push through changes that reduce affirmative action policies for lower socio-economic groups. Home Minister Amit Shah has consistently denied the party has any such plan, although that hasn’t stopped the opposition from exploiting voters’ anxiety around this.
The shift in momentum was in some evidence in the electorally important state of Uttar Pradesh, considered a stronghold for the BJP after it swept the region with 71 out of 80 seats in 2014 and won 62 in the 2019 elections.
Akhilesh Yadav, leader of the Samajwadi Party, the biggest opposition group in Uttar Pradesh, has been drawing significant crowds to political rallies, where he campaigns alongside alliance members, like the Congress party and the Trinamool Congress. The alliance parties have agreed not to contest seats against each other, allowing them to consolidate the opposition vote against the BJP.
WATCH: How India's Leader Is Preparing for a 1,000-Year Legacy
Yadav and Rahul Gandhi, the face of the Congress party, were due to address a rally together earlier this week in a town in Uttar Pradesh, but were forced to leave after throngs of supporters rushed the stage to see the two leaders, pushing through police barricades.
The two men, relatively young leaders in their 50s, represent change for the voters who are disillusioned with the decade-long rule of 73-year-old Modi. Heading into a third term, the “brand value of Modi isn’t there” and the opposition is putting up a strong fight in Uttar Pradesh, said Sunita Aron, an author of three books on Indian politics, including a biography on Yadav.
“The body language between Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi shows they’re friendly, they share a camaraderie,” said Aron, who was an executive editor for the Hindustan Times in Uttar Pradesh for more than two decades. “If the two leaders are standing on a stage, holding hands, that sends a message to the cadres on the ground that we’re coordinating, we’re working together.”
Uttar Pradesh was once again seen as a walkover for the BJP when the election began, but Aron said there’s now at least 25-30 seats in contention for the opposition.
“The BJP has an edge, but the alliance is giving it a good fight,” she said.
The clamor for change was evident on Tuesday at a rally in the rural town of Bhadohi, in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Flying in on a helicopter that sent dust clouds high up in the air, Yadav was cheered on by more than 8,000 supporters, predominantly young men, waiting in 40-degree heat to catch a glimpse of the leader, campaigning there on behalf of a candidate from the Trinamool Congress.
Yadav told his supporters the alliance will increase government jobs and waive loans for farmers, prompting huge roars from the crowd. In an interview after his speech, he criticized the Modi government for its policies and said the ruling party was losing support because of rising joblessness and inflation. He said the opposition alliance was aligned on its priorities, including improving affirmative action policies for the lowest caste groups.
He predicted the BJP will lose its majority and the opposition will form the government.
“The BJP route to power was through Uttar Pradesh, now they are losing all seats and that will be their end,” Yadav said.

"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Astha Rajvanshi,Narendra Modi Secured a Third Term as India’s Prime Minister—But With Less Power Than Expected,"India's ruling party fell short of winning a single-party majority, marking a stark departure from the last two elections.",https://time.com/6985447/india-election-results-modi-bjp/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24156556261968.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,2024-06-04T17:05:53Z,"Political pundits and exit polls were quick to predict that Narendra Modi was poised to clinch a third term as India’s prime minister in this year’s elections, which began on April 19 and concluded on June 1. The question was: could his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), win enough votes to claim a supermajority? 
The answer became clear as the final results trickled in on Tuesday, June 4. With more than 50% of the votes counted, the BJP and its National Democratic Alliance (which consists of several rightwing, conservative regional parties) have so far won 290 seats in India’s 543-seat Lok Sabha, or the lower house of parliament—falling short of the 400-seat mark the alliance boasted it would win, and effectively losing the single-party majority Modi has enjoyed since first elected in 2014. The ruling party on its own has claimed 238 seats—also a stark departure from the BJP’s thumping victory in 2019 when it won an unprecedented 303 seats.
In contrast, the opposition INDIA alliance—which is made up of more than 20 opposition parties including the Indian National Congress—won 235 seats, performing better than expected. Final results are expected late on Tuesday or early on Wednesday.
Under India’s electoral system, the party or alliance that wins more than 272 seats in the 543-member parliament can form a government. The vote was carried out in seven phases over six weeks and saw over 1 billion Indians heading to the polls—making it the largest democratic election in the world.
73-year-old Modi, a charismatic yet polarizing leader, will preside over a rare, third consecutive term in office. Only one other Indian Prime Minister, Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru, who was India’s first prime minister, has done so before. Speaking at the BJP’s headquarters in Delhi on Tuesday evening, Modi praised India’s election process and celebrated the BJP’s achievements. “No government has come back into power for a third time since 1962,” he said, adding the number of votes for the BJP had doubled in some areas.
But while Modi will likely be able to move forward with his promised Hindu-nationalist agenda and slate of economic reforms, the BJP’s smaller-than-expected majority means that he may face a more powerful opposition than at any point over the past decade—making implementation difficult unless the BJP negotiates with smaller alliances and opposition leaders.
“This election is undoubtedly a rebuke for Modi and the BJP,” says Milan Vaishnav, the Director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “After ten years in power, it was in many ways a referendum on its track record in office and there are clearly many Indians who are feeling restless and uneasy.” 
To win a landslide victory, the BJP needed to make electoral gains in two crucial areas.  It needed to break ground in the southern states, which seemed unlikely given that it has traditionally had less sway among a diverse and more economically developed non-Hindi-speaking electorate. And it needed to grab more votes in strongholds like Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, which is seen as a bellwether for how the rest of the country will vote.
The BJP managed to pull off stunning breakthroughs in the south, winning one seat in the left-leaning state of Kerala, where it has never won before. It retained its stronghold in Karnataka, grabbing 19 seats compared to nine for INDIA. And it tied in Telangana, where the opposition defeated the BJP in state elections held last year, by securing eight seats.
But surprisingly, the BJP performed unevenly across the Hindi belt and suffered perhaps its biggest loss in Uttar Pradesh, where Modi inaugurated a Hindu temple in the city of Ayodhya just months ago, fulfilling a three-decade-old BJP promise and cementing his Hindu-nationalist legacy. Early tally suggested the BJP alliance won only 35 out of 80 seats—a stark contrast to the 71 and the 62 seats won during the 2014 and 2019 elections that helped fuel the party’s rise to power in Delhi.
This time, a divisive campaign saw Muslim votes in the state consolidated for the opposition coalition, formed between two major parties, the Samajwadi Party and the Congress. “The loss in Uttar Pradesh is particularly significant as this state is the cradle of the Hindu nationalist movement,” says Gilles Vernier, a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi. “These results shatter the myth of [Modi’s] invincibility in national elections, particularly in the Hindi-speaking North.”
The BJP swept through its other stronghold states, including Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh. In comparison, the opposition alliance made marginal gains in Bihar and Rajasthan, as well as Haryana and Punjab. 
“What’s complex about this election is it appears more like a state-by-state contest with no unifying national narrative,” says Vaishnav. “At some point, the popularity of the alternatives and other local factors also become prime factors,” he continues.
In this election, Modi campaigned on the slogan of “Modi’s guarantee,” referring to the more than 300 welfare programs that have delivered benefits to Indian citizens across the country, ranging from cooking gas to free housing. While these benefits were viewed as a key concern for voters, research also found limited hard evidence of “schemes translating into votes.” 
Modi and the BJP also boasted of reducing poverty in the world’s fifth-largest economy, with development featuring high on the prime minister’s agenda. While India’s GDP grew at a rate of 7.8% in the last quarter, widening inequality, the rising cost of living, and record-high unemployment nevertheless remained big concerns for voters, as evident in credible pre-poll surveys.
“Narendra Modi’s government has ignored ground-level discontent about economic distress and jobless growth,” says Verniers. “This election might be the moment where economic reality caught up.”
Going into his third term, Modi has touted an ambitious economic reform agenda that he hopes will make India the world’s third-largest economy by 2047. The BJP’s failure to win a majority, however, means that he will now face a challenge in implementing his economic policy unless he forms alliances with smaller parties. The impact was already reverberating in India’s stock market early Tuesday when the Nifty 50 index tumbled as much as 8.5% —the biggest drop in a single day in more than four years—after surging to a record high on Monday, when exit polls indicated a comfortable Modi win. 
Modi now faces a more powerful opposition than at any point over the past decade. Throughout the election, the INDIA alliance has accused the government of crippling the opposition by jailing two state leaders and freezing Congress bank accounts. 
“For the first time since he became PM in 2014, Narendra Modi will have to share power effectively with coalition partners,” says Verniers. “This is uncharted territory for a leader who has always exercised power alone.” 
But the results are undoubtedly a personal setback for the prime minister, whose face has been the central promise of the BJP’s campaign this election—featured on billboards, posters, and campaigns across the country—and who has never had to depend on coalition partners for survival. 
“Only time will tell whether he will learn the art of conciliation and power-sharing, or press down the path of autocratization to compensate for the loss of political ground,” Vernier adds. 
“This is the most important question India faces at the moment.”

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi ended his 45-hour meditation at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari on Saturday.
 He was in Kanniyakumari on a spiritual visit. He meditated at the Dhyan Mandapam, where revered Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda is believed to have had a divine vision about ‘Bharat Mata’. This coincides with the conclusion of polling for the final phase of Lok Sabha polls.
Meanwhile, former Bihar Deputy CM and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav dismissed PM Modi’s spiritual activity in Kanniyakumari as mere “photo shoots.”
“Modi ji isn’t doing any meditation, only photo shoots are happening. Once the photo shoot ends, they will come back,” Yadav said.PM Modi arrived at Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari on Thursday.
According to mythology, Goddess Parvati also meditated on one foot at the same place as she waited for Lord Shiva.
Campaigning ends for 2024 Lok Sabha elections
This is the Southernmost tip of India. Further, this is the place where India’s Eastern and Western coastlines meet. It is also the meeting point of the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. PM Modi is sending a signal of national unity by going to Kanyakumari.
Prime Minister Modi concluded his election campaign in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur on Thursday, for the final phase of the general elections, which will be held on June 1.The Prime Minister held around 206 election campaign events, including rallies and roadshows, in 75 days. He also did around 80 interviews with different news and media platforms.
The Prime Minister undertakes spiritual journeys at the end of election campaigns. In 2019, he visited Kedarnath, and in 2014, he visited Shivaji’s Pratapgarh.
The election for 543 Lok Sabha seats is being held in seven phases starting April 19. The counting of the votes will be held on June 4.

The post IFF Raises Concerns Over ECI’s Misinformation Policies in Elections appeared first on MEDIANAMA.",https://www.medianama.com/2024/05/223-iff-letter-eci-misinformation-policy-elections/,https://www.medianama.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/82771326_1676835552456243_7686467553903771648_n.png,2024-05-17T11:38:14Z,"MEDIANAMA
Technology and policy in India
The Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group, wrote a letter to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to voice their concerns around inadequate and incomprehensive action taken by the electoral body regarding MCC violations by political parties.
The letter sent on May 13, 2024 looked at a letter sent by the ECI on May 6 to all national and state recognised political parties that cautioned against the use of “manipulated, distorted, edited content on social media platforms” that can “wrongfully sway voter opinions, deepen societal divisions, and erode trust in electioneering process by attacking laid out instrumentalities of the electoral steps in terms of means and material.” Here are the criticisms raised by the organization.
ECI directions contain constricted timelines and ambiguous phrasing: IFF urged the ECI to reconsider its direction on taking down “false, false, misleading” or ‘impersonating’ content, raising concerns about its impact on free speech and satire.
The organization pointed out that the direction fails to clarify its implications for satirical and parody accounts that may impersonate political parties or their representatives. Further, it warned that undefined terms like “fake” or “false” imply an objective, identifiable truth and create a binary of ‘true-false’ when in fact content in the digital space cannot always be categorized so.
“The use of terms such as “misinformation”, “patently false”, “untrue”, and “misleading” are reflective of the vague and arbitrary language used in the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (“IT Amendment Rules, 2023”). Reliance on such undefined terms allows for its misuse through subjective application and selective enforcement,” said the letter.
The advocacy group also noted that the direction does not specify whether political parties or another entity are responsible for identifying the content.
Excessively short timelines can cause panic: IFF also warned that the short deadline of identifying and taking down contentious content and their makers within three hours could result in panicked decisions.
“While the improvement of deepfakes detection and prevention of their rapid spread is important, none of this can be done without learning about the different types of deepfakes, understanding the complexities and high costs associated with the detection and attribution of such technologies, as well as the reason behind their virality,” said the IFF.
To illustrate, IFF gave the example of how cheapfakes, doctored/ edited media, or even authentic media are mislabelled as deepfakes, leading to disproportionate censorship. It warned that challenging or dismissing real online content by classifying it as fake may have deeper consequences for media legitimacy, especially in “politically fragile environments.” Thus, it asked the ECI to “realistically assess” the awareness and ability of political parties to identify/detect AI generated media.
“The detection of AI generated media, especially automated detection tools that use AI, may not be completely accurate. AI detection tools or systems may be biased in themselves and so their result may end up being discriminatory. Existing research also highlights the lack of consensus around the impact of generative media on misinformation,” said the letter.
It warned that researchers have said “such “moral panics” might be based on the mistaken assumption that people are gullible” and advised against excessive and speculative warnings about the ill effects of AI on the public arena and democracy.
GAC not an effective body to resolve MCC violations: The ECI directs parties to approach the Grievance Appellate Committee (GAC) under Rule 3A of the IT Rules, 2021 in case of “continued presence of such unlawful information or fake user account after reporting to social media platform”. However, the GAC is an executive-constituted committee that adjudicates on user appeals against the content moderation decisions of intermediaries.
“This essentially makes the Union Government (instead of, ideally, an independent judicial or a regulatory body) the arbiter of permissible speech on the internet as platforms are obligated to abide by the decisions of the GAC. It may also incentivise social media platforms and intermediaries to suppress any speech unpalatable to the government,” said the letter.
Definitional inadequacies in the IT Rules, legal uncertainty of the GAC, lengthy resolution procedures and the challenges in accurately identifying synthetic media, combined with the ongoing threats to the immunity held by platforms and stringent punishment for non-compliance or inaction, may threaten media freedom and legitimacy, said the IFF. Further, the ECI’s decision to specify “fake user account” in its directions raises concerns about anonymity on the internet.
Delayed and dispiriting response from the ECI: The IFF criticized the ECI for its delayed response to the spread of AI-generated synthetic content after the end of two of the seven polls for Lok Sabha seats.
“The election period has seen several instances of circulation of disinformation and falsely contextualised content, including content with misleading communal narratives. Thus, we would like to note our disappointment with the ECI’s decision to limit their directions to political parties on the circulation of manipulated, edited, or distorted content and content pertaining to women, children, and animals. Despite several widely circulated pieces of content having misleading communal claims and allegations, both doctored/ manipulated and otherwise, the directions issued by the ECI do not explicitly mention the party representative’s duty towards not spreading content that “aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension between different castes and communities, religious or linguistic,”” said the IFF in the letter.
The advocacy group particularly criticized the ECI for the recent post by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Karnataka unit on X microblogging platform (formerly Twitter) which triggered nationwide outrage due to its communal attack on the Indian National Congress (INC).
“The ECI did not directly warn or take action against the BJP. The ECI’s silence on political speech that attacks a particular community is disappointing, especially given that at least one national party has filed a complaint against the BJP to the ECI for the aforementioned post and other content posted by the party that too violates the MCC, Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the Indian Penal Code, 1860,” said the IFF.
Responsibility when manipulated/ misleading media favours political actors: IFF said that manipulated/misleading AI-generated content, can become an essential instrument in elections to influence voters. The group asked the ECI to consider directing political parties and representatives to advocate against manipulated media that leads to a favourable outcome for them. IFF also wrote to the BJP and INC, regarding their responsibility not to use manipulated/misleading synthetic content and not to endorse any such content that may influence citizens who have a right to cast a free and informed vote.
“We must also consider voter’s potential inability to distinguish between real and synthetic content, leaving them vulnerable to deception and maybe even disenfranchisement. AI-powered disinformation campaigns can influence voter behaviour by spreading false narratives or amplifying divisive content. This fundamentally affects the ability of citizens to exercise their democratic right to cast a free and informed vote,” said the letter.

IMPHAL, June 5: Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) on Wednesday celebrated India bloc’s decisive victory in the 18th Lok Sabha elections in Manipur amid the presence of leaders of the party’s alliance in INDIA Manipur Bloc.
While celebrating the victory at Congress Bhavan here, elected MPs – Dr Angomcha Bimol Akoijam and Alfred Kanngam S Arthur – were also felicitated.
Speaking on the occasion, senior Congress leader and former Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh said that results of the recently held 18th Lok Sabha elections have clearly indicated that money power and violence have no place in democracy.
“The results showed that there is no place for violence in democracy. The people cannot always be controlled by guns and money powers,” he added.
“At least the people of Manipur have taught a lesson to those who indulged in violence to win the elections”, he also said.
The former chief minister then strongly reacted to the evacuation of minorities from their settlement places using security forces during the initial stage of the ethnic violence in the state.
Ibobi said such a way of evacuation of minority people from their settlement places using security forces during ethnic crises was not done in any part of the globe.
Instead of evacuating them, the government should have deployed additional security forces to protect their lives and properties at any cost, Ibobi also said.
“If they were allowed to stay in their settlement places with full security protection, the violence might have not escalated this way”, he observed.
Ibobi then said winning both the Lok Sabha seats is the triumph of the people of both the hills and the valley of the state besides the victory of the Congress and its INDIA bloc alliance”, he said.
MP-elect Alfred Kanngam S Arthur, speaking on the occasion, assured that he will work at his level best to fulfill the hopes and wellbeing of the people of the state.
“I will never disregard the people’s trust,” he said and added that people voted for him and his party (Congress) keeping their full faith that their wishes and desires will be converted into works.
He claimed that this is the first time in the electoral history of Manipur and people cast their votes in the true spirit of democracy while defying intimidations and threats they received during the electioneering.
Dr Akoijam, also speaking on the occasion, said that he had the happiest moment of his life when the true spirit of democracy was reflected in the recently concluded elections.
The former JNU professor re-assured that he would work with his best capacity to execute 90% of the promises he had kept during the election campaigns.
People’s representatives must work for the people, he said.

CHANDIGARH, June 2: With the exit polls predicting that Prime Minister Modi will retain power for a third straight term, former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday said the Congress party will accept actual results when they are out on June 4.
Hooda, the leader of opposition in the Haryana Assembly, emphasized the Congress will only recognize the actual results as he pointed to “frequent inaccuracies” of the exit polls.
Hooda, according to a statement, said the true verdict will emerge from the EVMs on June 4.
He highlighted the “overwhelming public support” for the Congress during the elections.
He claimed that people stood in support of the Congress during the election campaigns focusing on critical issues such as unemployment, crime, drug menace, inflation and agriculture.
Hooda, as per the statement, criticized the BJP for allegedly lacking substantial issues or a credible track record, suggesting that this has led to a significant loss of public confidence in the current government.
With the assembly elections barely a few months away in Haryana, Hooda also claimed that the electorate has already decided to back the Congress and vote for a change in the state.
He criticized the BJP government, alleging that it had failed to meet the expectations of the people.
Hooda said there are two lakh posts lying vacant in the state government which had not been filled up.
He also alleged that there was rising crime, drug menace and inflation, and pledged to redress these issues if the Congress comes to power in Haryana.
Meanwhile, senior Haryana BJP leader Subhash Barala said in Rohtak that on the basis of the feedback from party workers across the country and also going by the exit polls, the public has blessed Narendra Modi to become the prime minister for the third time.
Barala, who is a Rajya Sabha MP, claimed the NDA will win with an overwhelming majority.
Barala, who was also the convenor of the Lok Sabha election management committee for Haryana, said that going by the exit polls, the Congress and INDIA alliance is not visible anywhere on the ground.
Exit polls on Saturday predicted that Prime Minister Modi will retain power for a third straight term, with the BJP-led NDA expected to win a big majority in the Lok Sabha polls.
The results of the Lok Sabha elections will be declared on June 4. (PTI)

      The Lok Sabha election is drawing to a close, leaving us no better informed on India’s economic future. The campaigns of both the Congress-led INDIA and BJP have produced more questions than answers.

     
      India’s economic model is broken. The economy needs a structural transformation for moving labour out of unpaid distress work and disguised unemployment on farms to better-paying productive jobs in factories. Without this, we risk our enormous demographic dividend going waste. Besides, we should not have farmers toiling in the sun as the planet heats up.

     
      How do INDIA and BJP propose to kick-start that transformation? This is unclear from their manifestos, speeches and interviews. The campaign has generated noise on redistribution of wealth. In any country, it is legit to question how the competing claims of various interest groups on the distribution of gains from economic growth would be settled. It would help if INDIA’s Rahul Gandhi and the BJP’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi tell us what according to them is the best way to sort out distributional conflicts and handle inevitable trade-offs.

     
      Gandhi ought to explain INDIA’s policy position on the Congress manifesto promise of legal minimum support prices (MSPs) for farm produce. A similar proposal for law-backed MSPs, agriculture economist Ashok Gulati said, was rejected by Manmohan Singh of the Congress when he was PM. Gulati was chairman the official body that recommends MSP hikes during Singh’s tenure. 

Also read: Farmers' protests and impact on Indian stock market - explainedHas the party disregarded Singh’s position on this subject or has he had a change of heart? Either way, the Congress must explain how price discovery can take place in farm markets if a legal MSP is made binding on all buyers. The fallout inescapably would be excess supply of MSP products and shortages of others. How will supply respond to demand in the absence of price signals?

     
      The PM, in turn, should explain his government’s modest record on macro-economic policies and the urgent changes they need. Three of the four engines of GDP growth—private consumption, private investments and exports—are out of steam. Increased welfare spending and ‘laabharthi’ economics haven’t quite fired consumption spending. Wages are not growing. Labour’s bargaining power is not improving.

     
      The government cut corporate tax rates and is making its capex sweat. But private investment remains sluggish. Economists at a conference on India’s economic growth at the Indian Statistical Institute last month debated if the fiscal multiplier is working at all. Has the relationship between public and private investment snapped?

     
      The fiscal stimulus administered by the Congress-led UPA government to help the economy recoup from the shock of a global crisis had sent the deficit rising. It was almost 6.5% of GDP in 2009-10 at its peak, after which the UPA reduced it by cutting spending and sacrificing GDP growth in the process. It bequeathed a fiscal deficit of almost 4.5% of GDP to the BJP government in 2014.

     
      The Modi government increased tax rates on fuels, which helped reduce the deficit to about 3.4% by 2018-19. However, the deficit started going up again, rising as high as 9.17% of GDP in covid year 2020-21 as lockdowns reduced tax collections. In April 2024, on the eve of elections, it was 5.8%, according to the 1 February budget’s estimate. 

     
      Even before the pandemic wrecked government finances, the government had already invoked the ‘escape clause’ of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act to take leeway in the fiscal deficit for 2019-20. No other government has ever invoked this clause.

     
      Given the implications for inter- generational equity, inflation and GDP growth, what does the PM think can be done to resolve India’s chronic fiscal stress problem?

     
      The Congress promise of  ₹1 lakh per year cash transfers to a woman in every poor household may be one way of nudging the economic growth engine of private consumption. But Gandhi should explain what data-base would be used to identify beneficiaries and avoid leaks, and if he has a plan to mitigate the increased risk of populism;  ₹1 lakh a year may be hiked ahead of every election season. It would also help to know if fiscal stress worries his party.

Also read: Nyay Patra: ‘  ₹1 lakh per year, 50% govt job quota’, Congress' key promises for women ahead of Lok Sabha pollsAs for the BJP, the 10-year record of its government rests largely on implementing ideas that originated in previous governments or states. Its flagship PM Kisan was taken from Telangana’s Rythu Bandhu and Odisha’s Kaliya. Its welfare narrative depends to a large extent on a rural employment guarantee and free foodgrain scheme that were inherited from the government led by Singh. The GST rollout and inflation-targeting framework for the central bank also originated in the Congress-led administration. Both were work-in-progress in 2014. 

     
      So too, the digital economy, including direct benefit transfers, which has been scaled from its modest debut on technology platforms built under the previous regime. The BJP’s signature ideas, demonetization and electoral bonds, turned out to be disasters. Electoral bonds were struck down by the Supreme Court for being unconstitutional. Is the BJP thinking of investing in its capacity for policy design?  
Has the party disregarded Singh’s position on this subject or has he had a change of heart? Either way, the Congress must explain how price discovery can take place in farm markets if a legal MSP is made binding on all buyers. The fallout inescapably would be excess supply of MSP products and shortages of others. How will supply respond to demand in the absence of price signals?

     
      The PM, in turn, should explain his government’s modest record on macro-economic policies and the urgent changes they need. Three of the four engines of GDP growth—private consumption, private investments and exports—are out of steam. Increased welfare spending and ‘laabharthi’ economics haven’t quite fired consumption spending. Wages are not growing. Labour’s bargaining power is not improving.

     
      The government cut corporate tax rates and is making its capex sweat. But private investment remains sluggish. Economists at a conference on India’s economic growth at the Indian Statistical Institute last month debated if the fiscal multiplier is working at all. Has the relationship between public and private investment snapped?

     
      The fiscal stimulus administered by the Congress-led UPA government to help the economy recoup from the shock of a global crisis had sent the deficit rising. It was almost 6.5% of GDP in 2009-10 at its peak, after which the UPA reduced it by cutting spending and sacrificing GDP growth in the process. It bequeathed a fiscal deficit of almost 4.5% of GDP to the BJP government in 2014.

     
      The Modi government increased tax rates on fuels, which helped reduce the deficit to about 3.4% by 2018-19. However, the deficit started going up again, rising as high as 9.17% of GDP in covid year 2020-21 as lockdowns reduced tax collections. In April 2024, on the eve of elections, it was 5.8%, according to the 1 February budget’s estimate. 

     
      Even before the pandemic wrecked government finances, the government had already invoked the ‘escape clause’ of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act to take leeway in the fiscal deficit for 2019-20. No other government has ever invoked this clause.

     
      Given the implications for inter- generational equity, inflation and GDP growth, what does the PM think can be done to resolve India’s chronic fiscal stress problem?

     
      The Congress promise of  ₹1 lakh per year cash transfers to a woman in every poor household may be one way of nudging the economic growth engine of private consumption. But Gandhi should explain what data-base would be used to identify beneficiaries and avoid leaks, and if he has a plan to mitigate the increased risk of populism;  ₹1 lakh a year may be hiked ahead of every election season. It would also help to know if fiscal stress worries his party.

Also read: Nyay Patra: ‘  ₹1 lakh per year, 50% govt job quota’, Congress' key promises for women ahead of Lok Sabha pollsAs for the BJP, the 10-year record of its government rests largely on implementing ideas that originated in previous governments or states. Its flagship PM Kisan was taken from Telangana’s Rythu Bandhu and Odisha’s Kaliya. Its welfare narrative depends to a large extent on a rural employment guarantee and free foodgrain scheme that were inherited from the government led by Singh. The GST rollout and inflation-targeting framework for the central bank also originated in the Congress-led administration. Both were work-in-progress in 2014.

SRINAGAR, May 11: Create a political space, mobilise people, find forces in the country who can ally with us and unite -? This is National Conference (NC) candidate from the Srinagar Lok Sabha seat Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi’s roadmap for restoration of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.
“We need to fight it politically, we need to mobilise people,” Mehdi told PTI in an interview.
“First encourage our people to express their opinion and then mobilise that opinion and create that political space where people can speak about it and stand for their rights,” Mehdi, an influential Shia leader, said.
The NC leader, a three-time former MLA from Budgam assembly segment, is the party’s candidate from Srinagar Lok Sabha constituency which has been represented by three generations of the Abdullahs.
He said the leadership needs to reach out to the entire population of Jammu and Kashmir to mobilise them and drum up support for the restoration of the special status which was revoked by the Centre on August 5, 2019.
“It is not about the party cadre only, it is not about a particular party, it is about entire Jammu and Kashmir.
“We need to reach out to them, we need to give them that energy and that strength and with that mobilisation, we need to take our cause to the government of India with the strength like other campaigns in the rest of the nation,” he added.
Mehdi said the leadership then needs to take the political mobilisation and opinion of the people to the rest of India and find allies.
“We need to find like-minded parties like those in south who want a federal India, who want stronger states. We need to find like-minded parties and forces with whom we can join forces and one day, find ways for our dignity to be returned.
“Who knows, in the course of restoring or making India a greater or stronger federal structure, we may get our dignity, our rights back because what south India espouses for is no different than from what we had and what Bengal and the northeast espouse for is no different from what we had,” he said.
He said the opinion in support of the restoration of Article 370 needs to be brought up from the grassroots to the national level to “get our dignity and rights back”.
Mehdi, who has been a strong votary of unity among the political leadership in Jammu and Kashmir, said electoral competitions aside, it is imperative to stand united for the “bigger cause”.
He had expressed displeasure after the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD),? an amalgam of various political parties seeking restoration of special status,? broke apart as NC and PDP could not come to a seat-sharing arrangement for the polls and announced to contest separately.
“PAGD or any other nomenclature that you want to have, the people of Jammu and Kashmir need unity,” he said.
He said “we have a bigger cause, which is bigger than these electoral competitions”.
“We need to stand and unite ourselves for that bigger cause and objective. So, PAGD has to unite again. If all the constituents of the PAGD are honest towards that cause, towards the people of J-K, we can forget whatever happened in this election.
“We had electoral competition, nothing lost. We can reunite and focus ourselves towards the cause that we have and that cause is bigger, it is larger than these objectives, electoral objectives,” Mehdi said.
The former minister said he envisions the PAGD getting together in the future.
“PAGD or any other name, unity among the people of J-K is incumbent upon us. We cannot avoid it if we want to espouse for that cause,” he added.
Asked if the alliance among PAGD parties could be cobbled up for the assembly elections then, he said “if everything goes well, maybe”.
“If PDP looks inside, inwards and introspects, and the same goes with the NC and I can assure that. But, if the PDP also has that introspection, and finds why the individuals created an atmosphere in that political party which destroyed that unity and brought that animosity,” he said.
Blaming certain leaders in the PDP for working at the behest of the “establishment” to break the PAGD, Mehdi asked “who was the individual or the individuals which were given a task by the forces or establishment in Delhi to break the unity and PAGD”.
The NC candidate said he can work towards unity among the political leadership in J-K.
“If they (PDP) do that introspection, if they have that realisation, I can try create that atmosphere, but only if they are honest. If the individual, those who were successful in breaking the PAGD have free hand in that party, I will be helpless.
“I have a certain control over how I can make opinion or shape opinion in my party, but I do not have control over how opinion is shaped in PDP. So, they need to be serious, they need to be honest and I can be a helping hand if they honestly espouse for the cause,” he added.
Talking about his fallout with the party leadership, Mehdi said he had his reasons to have that disagreement with the party and “today if I feel somewhere that I need to express my disagreement, I will still do”.
“But, one thing is very encouraging that the party as a whole not only accommodated me, it gave respect to my dissent and my disagreements and we are in the process of correcting the course,” he said.
He said the party leadership has asserted that there could be disagreements in the approach, but the objective is same.
“That is an encouragement for me, a positive for me and that keeps this relation intact. As long as we espouse for the same cause, we may have different approaches, it does not matter,” he said. (PTI)

On June 4, India will release the official results of its 2024 parliamentary elections, bringing this six-week saga to a close. India’s elections are the largest democratic exercise in world history, with nearly a billion registered voters participating.


India has been a democracy since its independence from Great Britain in 1947. Its constitution, which came into effect on January 26, 1950, is the world's longest and draws inspiration from Britain, Ireland and the US. 


Fundamentally, India’s system of government is based on the British Westminster model. The Parliament of India has two houses, the Rajya Sabha (House of the States) and the Lok Sabha (House of the People). The former is elected by state legislatures and is the upper house while the latter is elected directly by the people. The prime minister of India must command the support of the majority of the members of parliament (MPs) in the Lok Sabha just as the British prime minister has to command a majority in the House of Commons.


Sometimes, one party has commanded a full parliamentary majority. At other times, the largest party formed government by forging a coalition. Sometimes, larger parties support smaller parties but did not join the government. In this “outside support” tactic, the smaller parties’ leaders become prime ministers or state chief ministers. This experiment is unique to India.


How does a party “win” the Lok Sabha elections?


India is a large, vibrant, rambunctious democracy. After independence, numerous observers predicted that this poor, inexperienced country would fall into authoritarianism. India defied them all. Even under the Indira Gandhi government — India’s closest experience with Soviet-inspired one-party rule — multiparty elections continued.

Reasons Why India’s Big Democracy Is Dynamic



This vast nation is divided into 543 constituencies, each of which elects one Member of Parliament (MP) to the Lok Sabha. To become prime minister, a leader must have the support of 272 MPs. Thus, either one party must win 272 seats or it must find enough coalition partners to make up the magic number.


Like British parliamentary constituencies and US congressional districts, Indian constituencies use the first-past-the-post system. In this system, there is only one round of voting, and the candidate with the greatest number of votes wins, regardless of whether the candidate secures 50% of the votes. This means that if many parties fight for one seat, the candidate who gets the highest votes wins. The victor just needs one vote more than the runner-up. In 2019, the BJP won a thumping majority by winning 37.36% of the national vote. Every winning party has fallen short of the 50% vote share, including the fabled post-independence Jawaharlal Nehru-led Indian National Congress (INC).


India’s elections are largely freely and fair. In the past, violence was common during elections, as was voter intimidation. Booth capturing, a practice where goons of candidates captured voting booths and stuffed ballot boxes, was part and parcel of Indian elections. No longer is such behavior acceptable to a much more informed and assertive electorate.


The Election Commission is autonomous. It takes charge when elections are announced. Many polling booths are set up in constituencies so that people can vote in their own neighborhoods. Workers from all political parties are present at polling booths. They check both the voter list and the integrity of the process. In contrast to earlier times, when one person could stamp many votes, electronic voting machines (EVMs) have to reset each time after someone votes. In the 1990s, T.N. Seshan brought in reforms that have made elections a lot fairer than in the past.


Those who cast doubt on EVMs forget that even Indira Gandhi did not find it easy to tamper elections. The size and scale of the Indian electorate make it very difficult for anyone to rig the elections. Even in 1977, Indira Gandhi lost the elections even though she had imposed the “Emergency” and was a de facto dictator.


Indian elections are a lot cleaner than before


Many in the Indian opposition are seeking answers that explain their poor performance. They might be convinced that they merit more votes. In India, politicians tend to have big egos and cannot accept that either their performance or positioning might be lacking. So, they conjure up conspiracy theories to explain poor election results.


In part, Modi’s ascent is thanks to Seshan’s reforms and the EVMs. In the poorer parts of the country, people did not even turn up to vote. They were afraid of retribution. The Election Commission deployed police forces from other states to conduct elections, and this boosted confidence in the election process.


This increased confidence has allowed leaders like Modi and Arvind Kejriwal, the leader of the relatively new Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), to emerge. Aam aadmi literally means “the common man.” Both the BJP and the AAP have leveraged technology and, like new businesses, have demonstrated more energy than the legacy business of the INC.


Since the start of Indian democracy, black money has played a role in the elections. A colorful and powerful politician remarked a few decades ago that elections were all about money, muscle power and mass appeal. The second of the two factors has declined, but the first still matters. Now, candidates are no longer giving money in sacks to journalists, student leaders, mullahs, temple priests et al. 


These intermediaries no longer matter. They cannot turn out the vote for any party. So, they do not get any money. Today, parties spend money on private jets, helicopters and hotel rooms during political campaigns. Just like the US, money is the oxygen every party and candidate needs to campaign. Unlike the US, this money comes in the form of cash. Businesses with cash such as real estate firms, lotteries and liquor chains paid political parties “off the record, on the QT and very hush-hush.”


That is why electoral bonds came into being. The argument for these bonds was that they would formalize campaign finance. They would be anonymous so that businesses would be safe from retribution for donating to one political party. Yet the Supreme Court struck down this measure. The argument of the court is that companies buying these bonds secretly casts a doubt on the integrity of the election process. Indians have a right to know who is financing their parties.


The role of money in politics has led to allegations of crony capitalism. Businessmen back politicians who then favor them in a quid pro quo. In manufacturing, real estate and many other businesses, this shadow system prevails. In India, the capitalist class participates in the political process and spreads their bets. India does not quite have the Southeast Asian-style crony capitalism that we see in countries like Indonesia. Indian politics is far more fragmented.

On June 4, India will release the official results of its 2024 parliamentary elections, bringing this six-week saga to a close. India’s elections are the largest democratic exercise in world history, with nearly a billion registered voters participating.
India has been a democracy since its independence from Great Britain in 1947. Its constitution, which came into effect on January 26, 1950, is the world's longest and draws inspiration from Britain, Ireland and the US. 
Fundamentally, India’s system of government is based on the British Westminster model. The Parliament of India has two houses, the Rajya Sabha (House of the States) and the Lok Sabha (House of the People). The former is elected by state legislatures and is the upper house while the latter is elected directly by the people. The prime minister of India must command the support of the majority of the members of parliament (MPs) in the Lok Sabha just as the British prime minister has to command a majority in the House of Commons.
Sometimes, one party has commanded a full parliamentary majority. At other times, the largest party formed government by forging a coalition. Sometimes, larger parties support smaller parties but did not join the government. In this “outside support” tactic, the smaller parties’ leaders become prime ministers or state chief ministers. This experiment is unique to India.
India is a large, vibrant, rambunctious democracy. After independence, numerous observers predicted that this poor, inexperienced country would fall into authoritarianism. India defied them all. Even under the Indira Gandhi government — India’s closest experience with Soviet-inspired one-party rule — multiparty elections continued.

Berhampore Court railway station was chock-a-block with the home-bound crowd. A jampacked Lalgola local from Kolkata’s Sealdah railway station arrived a few minutes ago on Sunday afternoon.
Overcrowded trains have been coming from Kolkata for the last five days as people, residing in other districts of West Bengal and in other states, are returning to their hometown to cast their votes, Railway officials said.
Baharampur Lok Sabha constituency in Murshidabad district in South Bengal is going to the polls on Monday in the fourth phase of the elections. 
“Due to the lack of employment opportunities in Murshidabad district, a large number of people move to other parts of West Bengal and also to other states. This backward region supplies cheap labour across the country. Many of these migrant workers are returning now to exercise their franchise,” said Tausar Ali, a local school teacher.
Outside the Berhampore Court railway station, the Congress erected a large hoarding with a smiling face of the party’s veteran leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.
Chowdhury, the state Congress chief, is seeking re-election from his Baharampur seat. The senior MP has held this Muslim-dominated seat since 1999. The ruling Trinamool Congress in the state has fielded former cricketer Yusuf Pathan, who had played for Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, from the constituency, which has been a stronghold for Chowdhury. And, for the BJP, well-known local doctor Nirmal Kumar Saha is contesting the seat.
“Adhir Chowdhury is facing a tough contest this time. Earlier, he won from this constituency comfortably. But this time, the constituency is witnessing a strong triangular contest. Yusuf Pathan is going to give him a very tough fight,” said Ali.
Ali’s view is seconded by Arun Dey, a bookseller who has a big book store at Gora Bazar in Baharampur city. “Adhir is still a very popular leader here. But Congress’s strength has diminished. You need your party’s strength for elections. At the same time, the strengths of both the TMC and BJP have recently increased,” Dey pointed out.
“In a backward region like this, Mamata Banerjee’s Lakshmir Bhandar is a huge hit. Moreover, in the Muslim-majority areas, Yusuf Pathan will garner a large percentage of minority votes, which will be an unfavourable condition for even a veteran leader like Adhir Chowdhury,” he added. 
To his comfort, as an India bloc candidate Adhir is getting powerful support from the CPI (M) and its senior leaders like Mohammed Salim.
Aniket Marjit, a local hotelier, said the BJP has a strong base in the business community here. “The BJP has been steadily increasing its strength. Also, Saha is a popular doctor. That will help the saffron party. Yusuf Pathan is likely to get support of young voters. As a result, Adhir Chowdhury is under pressure in this elections. Finally, he is likely to win, but his vote margin will surely decrease compared to that of the last time,” Marjit added.
Political analyst Biswanath Chakraborty said, “Chowdhury is in a crisis of religion.”
“Trinamool Congress is trying to mobilise the majority of Muslim voters by fielding Pathan and delivering targeted speeches during its election campaigns. And the backlash against this campaign is a likely polarisation of Hindu votes. So, it becomes a challenge for Chowdhury to seek votes from a secular point of view. At the same time, the voters in this constituency are also facing an emotional problem as he has been a popular leader among all communities throughout his political career,” Chakraborty added.

PM Narendra Modi will round up his whirlwind campaign throughout the Lok Sabha elections with rallies in West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Odisha, which, together with five other States and Union Territories, will go to the polls in the final phase on June 1. There are 57 parliamentary constituencies in the last round of polling.
So far, Modi has done about 150 rallies and road shows in the six phases, including a few rounds of his parliamentary seat, Varanasi, which will also vote on June 1. 
As per the schedule, Modi is supposed to address two public meetings on Tuesday in West Bengal, where the party is locked in a fierce battle against the ruling Trinamool Congress.
The PM will wind up the day with a road show in Kolkota to push the prospects of Tapas Roy in North Kolkata, the seat that the BJP is eyeing to gain entry into the heart of the West Bengal capital.
Before that, Modi will be in Jharkhand’s Godda to campaign for sitting party MP Nishikant Dubey, who is pitted against Dipika Pandey Singh of Congress. Singh is the incumbent MLA of Mahagama, one of the Vidhan Sabha seats under the Godda Lok Sabha constituency, which the BJP has won eight out of nine times in the past.
In the high-stakes battle being fought over Modi’s image and his government’s performance, the PM continues to lead from the front. In many places, he has done more than one public meeting.
On May 29, he will again reach out to the public of West Bengal through a rally in the Diamond Harbour parliamentary seat, South 24 Parganas, to take on sitting MP Abhishek Banerjee, TMC general secretary, and the nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. BJP’s Abhijit Das is in the fray from this seat, which the party lost to Banerjee by a margin of over three lakh votes.
After Bengal, Modi is scheduled to target Odisha, a State the PM himself recently said will yield rich dividends this time both in the Assembly and LS elections. The PM will address public meetings in Balasore, Mayurbhanj, and Kendrapada in a concerted bid to take on the ruling Biju Janata Dal.
Before the campaigning ends, 48 hours before the polling on June 1, Modi and the entire BJP top brass and other leaders will converge at Varanasi.
Modi began his electoral campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections from Meerut in Western UP, as he did in 2014 and 2019, and since then, he has travelled across the length and breath of the country to spend at least 18 hours per day to retain power the third time in a row. Additionally, he gave at least 40 interviews to national and vernacular media to maximise public outreach.
The other star campaigners from the BJP who have had an all-India presence during the campaigning are Modi’s close confidant and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and BJP president JP Nadda.
Before the last and final round of polling, Shah will be addressing rallies in Balia, Deoria, Robertsganj, and Maharganj in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh.
Similarly, Rajnath Singh will hold eight more rallies and road shows in the remaining days of campaigning. So far, said BJP leaders, Singh spent 39 days travelling to 21 States and Union Territories to hold 93 public meetings and road shows in 87 constituencies, including seven visits to his Lucknow seat, from where he is contesting for the third time.
Yogi Adityanath, who was much in demand by the candidates and State units, has done about 120 rallies and road shows.
In the last phase of the election, thirteen seats each in UP and Punjab, nine seats in West Bengal, eight seats in Bihar, six seats in Odisha, four seats in Himachal Pradesh, three seats in Jharkhand, and one seat in the Union Territory of Chandigarh will go to the polls.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate Magazine'}",Nitish Pahwa,The World’s Biggest Deepfake Election Just Gave Us a Glimpse Into November’s Chaos,It was a blow to Modi’s authoritarian grip—and a win for scrappy digital activists.,https://slate.com/technology/2024/06/india-elections-modi-tech-artificial-intelligence-deepfakes-activists.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/9d5092f5-5b03-4d9c-bfe2-474d129754df.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,2024-06-06T16:09:27Z,"If India’s most recent elections proved anything, it’s that the “world’s largest democracy” may yet still be worthy of that name. The results of the six-week cycle, which saw more than 640 million voters turn out across the subcontinent, dealt a steep blow to the demagogic Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which lost its single-party hold over the majority of seats in India’s lower house of Parliament, the Lok Sabha. The Hindu nationalist BJP still snapped up most of the electorate’s votes, and Modi is bound to continue as head of state, but he and his cronies will no longer enjoy the untrammeled federal power they have held for the past half-decade (forget the 400 seats they’d aimed to nab in this election).
The INDIA Alliance, a multiparty coalition of opposition candidates, has flipped dozens of seats, and the BJP will have to rely on parliamentary allies—who already desire some significant changes to Modi’s Hindu supremacist governing style—for a majority. In light of the clean sweep Modi and Co. achieved in 2019, the increasingly authoritarian grip they brought to India’s institutions, the economic depression that has afflicted Indians in the Modi years, the protest movements that resultantly flared up, and the formerly BJP-supporting constituencies the party lost this round, it’s hard to view this outcome as anything but a popular rebuke of Modi’s antidemocratic excesses.
Those excesses include the powerful tech apparatus the BJP has employed since Modi first campaigned for national office in 2013. Popularly recognized as “India’s first social media prime minister,” known for cozying up to Silicon Valley magnates, and boosted mightily by wealthy tech-world allies, Narendra Modi promised to be the avatar of “Digital India,” with a presence as ubiquitous online as off. During this time, more of India’s 1.4 billion people were gaining access to cheap phones, mobile data, and internet bandwidth.
That virtual face had a hateful glow starting early on, as the BJP hired volunteer stooges to target Modi critics, journalists, members of non-BJP parties, Muslims, and other minorities with harassment campaigns, inflammatory disinformation, and death threats. These proudly self-identified trolls deluged Facebook, Twitter (pre-X), and especially WhatsApp with pro-Modi propaganda, and eventually built out a sophisticated army with strategic cells and on-the-ground foot soldiers deployed across the country. They benefited, too, from either knowing inaction or blatant acquiescence from American platforms that wished to keep doing business with India’s massive consumer bases—even as these BJP initiatives sparked grisly real-life pogroms.
In a more recent example: When Elon Musk took over Twitter, the CEO was happy to oblige Modi’s aggressive requests to ban or obscure accounts of dissidents and even countries perceived as unfavorable to Modi. Musk also restored the accounts of nationalist officials and activists who’d been previously booted for violating Twitter policy. (YouTube and Facebook haven’t done much better, although Meta has stood firm against the Indian government’s request to break WhatsApp’s encryption.)
These social media horrors, combined with the government’s censorship efforts, fostered an informational environment in India ripe for exploitation by artificial intelligence. The country’s right-leaning platforms embraced the A.I. moment in early 2023: The hate-filled Twitter clone Koo incorporated ChatGPT into its text boxes, and an engineer based in Indian tech hub Bangalore crafted a “GitaGPT” app that spawned a proliferation of “talking” Hindu-deity chatbots praising Modi and promoting violent acts on behalf of Hinduism. When women wrestlers rose up later that year to protest a coach (and BJP politician) who they claimed had sexually harassed many of them, party acolytes used A.I. to edit an image the wrestlers had posted to social media while they were held in police custody—making it appear as though they were smiling instead of showing their disgust with the system.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a former student activist began a popular, nonideological contract service called the Indian Deepfaker, which was soon “approached by a political party to translate the video of a politician’s speech in Hindi to a regional language,” according to the Indian fact-checking site Boom. After the Indian Deepfaker went viral for incorporating Kangana Ranaut—an actress and far-right provocateur who just won a Lok Sabha seat for the BJP—into a cocked-up Barbie trailer, other A.I. enthusiasts began deepfaking Indian politicians, even creating voice clones that could be translated into some of India’s most common regional tongues. The newfound capability presented an advantage for national politicians versed primarily in India’s official language, Hindi, to transmit communications to voters in southern states in other languages and dialects, like Kannada and Malayalam.
Soon enough, a guitar-playing A.I. Modi was singing in Telugu on Instagram. The right-wing Insta profile Hokage Modi Sama paid to boost hundreds of Midjourney-generated deepfakes that made Modi resemble figures from Hindu mythology. In Tamil Nadu, the chief minister used an A.I. re-creation of his dead father to offer some kind words to his son in a public forum. Other regional and opposition political parties, like the historic (and historically weak) Congress Party, shared deepfakes of celebrities and politicians endorsing preferred candidates or denouncing opponents (without those original speakers’ permission).
Modi himself spoke out against the trend late last year, but it only continued to intensify, to the point that various tech companies earned more than $50 million from political parties to produce A.I. images and videos, per Rest of World—which paid off quite well, considering how cheap it became to put this stuff out (“costs less than a cup of tea”). There was such a glut, in fact, that Modi and the BJP started labeling unfavorable videos as deepfakes even when they were very real. It was enough of a threat that they sent cops to arrest Congress Party workers who crafted deepfakes of Modi aides.
It’s obvious why the A.I. sludge was a core storyline in the year’s elections. Still, there’s reason to believe overall that the A.I. saturation was less effective, and more spammy and confusing—and that the key story as to why the BJP suffered a setback this round belongs to media dissenters who expertly weaponized their platforms in the face of oppression.
Independent news websites that took to digital channels to reach readers beyond newspaper circulation and TV broadcasts were hounded by the government to a frightening extent: Fahad Shah, editor in chief of the Kashmir Walla, was baselessly tossed in prison for “glorifying terrorism,” and the government shut down his publication shortly after. The founder of NewsClick was arrested in October under “terror” charges and freed only last month, after the country’s Supreme Court intervened. A similar incident occurred in 2022 with Mohammed Zubair, the co-founder of the fact-checking resource and frequent BJP poker Alt News.
Yet if the desired effect was to chill such alternate voices, the government’s actions had an opposite effect—boosting these journalists’ profiles and making them international free-speech heroes. That effect was magnified for India’s YouTubers, who’ve found ample success in reaching Indians across language and geographic divides as traditional media (often referred to as “Godi media”) loses credibility and audience share. Some famous YouTube pundits are even former TV newscasters.
None were more influential, perhaps, than Dhruv Rathee, an influencer-historian with 21 million subscribers and a relentless tendency to fact-check all the lies from and false media coverage of Modi and the BJP. Branding himself as an “independent” voice with digital savvy, whose videos gain traction across Instagram and X and WhatsApp, Rathee never softened his rhetoric against Modi and Co. throughout the election. While breaking down various scandals—party members paying off voters, Modi’s autobiographical embellishments, the national persecution of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal—Rathee used strong words like dictatorship and brainwashing, in a refreshing break from the pro-Modi mainstream media lines. When the election results came in, Indians took to X to point out how Rathee had been correct in his critiques of Modi, even as TV outlets kept insisting that the BJP would see an out-and-out victory this round.

Ultimately, despite the cheap deepfakes, Modi’s popularity, the violent nature of modern Indian politics, and a media apparatus in thrall to the BJP, digital journalists and influencers managed to counter the ruling party’s narrative in the places where it counted. As I noted back in 2021, a combination of post-COVID economic devastation and popular uprisings hinted at coming weaknesses for the Modi coalition, one that couldn’t just be papered away by Islamophobia and paeans to India’s greatness.
A lot of women, rural, and lower-caste voters felt that pinch, and they were receptive to the message from Rathee and his fellow YouTubers—that Modi, in fact, was not bringing them the prosperity he promised and was interested mainly in covering up for corrupt friends or stoking religious violence. There may be a lesson here for those worried about how deepfakes will influence another significant election this year: the United States’.

'While I was performing it, I had a weird feeling that people would love it because it's so bizarre.'

Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, has brought back both Shekhar Suman and his son Adhyayan into our living rooms, and also in the news. Even as Shekhar celebrates this new chapter as an actor, he has also returned to politics after 15 years.
In the first part of a long conversation with Rediff.com Senior Contributor Roshmila Bhattacharya, Shekhar says, ""There's a sense of catharsis, redemption and validation, gaiety and victory. We've gone through some bad times, but that's life! I'm proud Adhayayan took it on his chin and fought back with dignity. We are the happiest family right now.""
Let's start with Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar and your character, Nawab Zulfikar, who grabbed the audience's attention in the very first episode with a fellatio scene that wasn't what it appeared to be. It took a few seconds to figure out what was happening...
(Guffaws) Yeah, many were wondering, 'What is this guy doing?' and when it finally began to sink in, they were like, 'Oh my God!'
As a kid, I remember watching Amitji (Amitabh Bachchan) reprimanding God in Deewar, 'Aaj khush to bahut hoge.'
It was an audacious scene as it's blasphemous for a man to be firing God, so it took people a while to understand, but when they did, it was an OMG moment too.
That scene has since become iconic.
I'm not drawing parallels here, but Heeramandi wasn't just another sex scene, there are nuances and subtexts here that a discerning audience will get.
You are referring to the political undertones?
Yes. My character is a man who wants the best from life which can only come from sycophancy.
But he is also far-sighted and tells Manisha's (Koirala) Mallikajaan that once the British leave, there will be a lot of bloodshed, with many of our own dying while fighting each other.
That's what happened after Partition.
There were communal riots, innocents were slaughtered, and with the abolishment of the privy purses, nawabs like Zulfikar lost their riyasat.
When Mallikajaan accuses the British of divide and rule, he points out that tawaifs like her are doing the same, dividing the nawabs from their begums and ruling over them.
The scene is laden with interpretations.

Did you expect it to become a talking point?
I'm not surprised it has because when you work with a master craftsman like Mr Sanjay Bhansali, every shot and scene will be talked about.
While I was performing it, I had a weird feeling that people would love it because it's so bizarre.
The way it was written, Zulfikar and Mallikajaan are sitting close together in the carriage, holding hands, him whispering into her ear.
But on the day of the shoot, though the lines remained the same, Mr Bhansali changed the scene completely, giving it a unique interpretation and bringing out through Zulfikar's drunken stupor, the decadence and pathos of a man who has fallen from grace.
He also told me in no uncertain terms that I had the liberty to say no.
And did you, even for a moment, think of saying no?
I told him I wanted to go the whole hog.
If Mr Bhansali had thought of it, that was a good enough reason to do it.
Drunken scenes are hard to pull off because they are either over-the-top or under played; the pitch is never right.
This one was a bigger challenge, so I decided there would be no rehearsals and it would be a one-take performance.
There was no brazenness, I performed with complete conviction.
(Chuckles) I improvised as I went along, adding the 'Ahista... Gently', which surprised even Mr Bhansali for a moment before realisation dawned.
Then he was like, 'Oh my God, this is so good!'
After we shot it, Mr Bhansali came to me, jumping with joy and clapping his hands, 'Magnificent! This will be historic!'
I remember Aanand Mahendroo, who developed, edited and directed the sitcom Dekh Bhai Dekh, telling me the same thing back in the '90s after that scene where I fell down the stairs.
He had prophesied that scene would become iconic.

Walk us through that again...
Well, I was wearing shoes with rubber soles and there was a carpet. (My character) Sameer, who works in the share market, learns that share prices are falling, and he falls down the stairs in disbelief.
This has never happened before and when he falls a second time, he is startled.
He hears Bhavana's (Balsavar) Sunita coming and waits for her to fall too, but she sails down.
So then, he goes back up and while coming down, falls again.
I had to fall thrice, and got it right in one take every time, and returned home happy.
At 2 am, Aanand called and exulted, 'You don't know what you have done!'
Groggy, I wondered if I had done anything wrong, and he announced, 'You have created history!'
I didn't believe him, but he insisted everyone was watching the scene again and again in the editing room and clapping each time.
'You have to come here right now and watch it with us,' he demanded.
I did, and stayed till breakfast.
Sometimes, little scenes rather than long monologues give an actor so much joy.

How did your wife react to the intimate scene with Manisha Koirala?
(Laughs) When I returned from the shoot, I told Alka that I had done something crazy, but didn't tell either her or my son (Adhyayan) what, as I wanted it to come as a surprise.
My wife enjoyed it when she saw it at the premiere.
Alka almost fell off her chair laughing when towards the end, Mallikajaan steps out of the carriage, shuts the door with total disdain on Zulfikar sprawled out in satiated sleep and imperiously tells the buggy driver to drop him home.
It had faintly crossed my mind whether some would take umbrage, but watching the scene in the theatre, all doubts vanished.
An intimate scene where the partners don't even touch each other, it reminded of your first film, Utsav, which back in the '80s was considered revolutionary in its sex scenes.
Yes, life has come a full circle.
Utsav was also a period film with lavish sets, extravagant costumes and jewellery and my character, Charudutt, is in love with a courtesan, Rekha's Vasantsena.
The bathing scene was so erotic and yet, there was no physicality.
It is so aesthetically done, like a painting or poetry.
Girishji's (Director Girish Karnad) diktat to all of us was to feel our characters and the moment.
Cinematographer Ashok Mehta used only candles to light up the scene.
All my love-making scenes with Rekha were so beautiful, it would be a sin to call them sex scenes.

Reportedly, Sanjay Bhansali originally had Rekha in mind to play Mallikajaan. Had Heeramandi been made 20 years ago, you could have been doing the scene with Rekha.
Imagine that!
It would have had a different kind of chemistry though because while Charudutt was a sedate, innocent Brahmin, Zulfikar is a conniving nawab.
Getting back to the Heeramandi...
(Breaks in) I had no sense of objectivity when doing the scene, but while dubbing it, I realised it would have a definitive impact on the minds of cine-goers.
No one had experimented with something like this before, bringing a degree of sexuality into the scene without making it look obscene.
There's another powerful scene where Zulfikar holds Mallikajaan by the scruff of her neck and tells her that she will be dead, floating naked in the fountain, if she doesn't give him the file.
His sudden anger and aggression scares her.
She says uncertainly, 'Aap mazak kar rahe ho na? and he replies, 'Hum aagha kar rahe hain (I'm warning you).'
She shoots back, 'Do you doubt me?' and he responds, 'Yes, I doubt you, but I also love you.'
It's such a joy for an actor to work with maestros like K Asif, Kamal Amrohi, Guru Dut, Raj Kapoor, Bimal Roy and Sanjay Leela Bhansali who will hone your latent talent by giving you such layered characters.

What was it like sitting with your wife and son and watching the series, which also features Adhyayan as your on-screen son, Zoravar?
To be sharing the screen in a magnum opus with my son was gratifying and exhilarating.
While performing our scenes together, I had a three-pronged reaction -- that of a father proud of his son, an actor watching him with scepticism and finally, as the character.
There was one scene which unfortunately edited out, where the tension between us is palpable after Zoravar discovers that he was conceived with a prostitute and his father abandoned him.
The anger, angst and aggression is reflected in the way he sits before Zulfikar, a cigarette dangling in his hand and screaming out his defiance.
There are so many subtle nuances that only someone well versed with a script would notice.
What's the atmosphere like in the Suman home today?
There's a sense of catharsis, redemption and validation, gaiety and victory.
We've gone through some bad times, but that's life!
I'm proud Adhayayan took it on his chin and fought back with dignity.
We are the happiest family right now.

You have returned to politics after 15 years. What prompted you to join BJP?
Passion, compassion and emotion.
The Heeramandi milieu brought along a need to do something for society and the country.
The series ends with martyrdom, a fight for freedom, and while India has since become an independent nation, our fight against poverty, inequality, illiteracy and incivility continues.
In this scenario, when I saw our Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, selflessly fighting to elevate the country's honour through the building of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, abolition of Article 370, pushing for a Uniform Civil Code, the atmanirbhar and vocal for local campaigns, I had to jump in.
My decision is more emotional than political.
I'm not here to fight elections, I just want to do something for my country.
Had you joined the party earlier, people might have believed you. But now coming in the midst of elections, it seems like a politically motivated decision.
People can read what they want into my intentions.
If I was an opportunist, I would have joined earlier and asked for a ticket.
At this point, there is nothing to ask for.
The BJP as a party in totality also has an emotional ideology in sanatan dharma, Ram and Aastha. I have aligned myself to that.
There's pride when I look at some of our airports and Mumbai's coastal road. I see progress and growth.
I'm an impulsive, spontaneous, person and for the first time, I did not discuss this decision with my wife or my son, my sisters or my friends because I did not want anybody to dissuade me.
Does your decision bring back memories of the 2009 Lok Sabha elections when you stood from Patna Saheb on a Congress ticket and lost to the BJP's Shatrughan Sinha?
That was an impulsive and premature decision and best forgotten.
One should not hark back on the past and lug around excess baggage.
It was a lesson I learnt and moved on to become a better and wiser person.

"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Al Jazeera Staff,India election 2024: Why isn’t Modi’s BJP fielding candidates in Kashmir?,Absence of the prime minister's party from electoral fray in Muslim-majority region seen as a sign of its unpopularity.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/13/india-election-2024-why-isnt-modis-bjp-fielding-candidates-in-kashmir,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP19144362432698-1715085583.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,2024-05-13T04:56:59Z,"The absence of the prime minister’s party from the electoral fray in the Muslim-majority region is seen as a sign of its unpopularity.
Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir – More than a month into India’s giant seven-phase national election, the Kashmir Valley will finally begin to cast its votes in one constituency, on May 13. The Indian-administered region will vote for two other constituencies on May 20 and May 25.
But missing from the fray is India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), known for its aggressive electoral ambitions, win-at-all-costs approach and aspirations of breaking ground in parts of the country where it has traditionally not had much success.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party has not fielded candidates in any of the three seats in the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.
Experts and rivals argue the Hindu majoritarian party wants to avoid an outcome that may challenge its claims of bringing development and peace to the Himalayan region, which has seen decades of armed rebellion against Indian rule.
The BJP denies that it has anything to hide and insists the region has changed for the better since Modi’s government in 2019 scrapped Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which had granted a measure of autonomy to Indian-administered Kashmir. New Delhi also split the region into two federally-governed territories: Jammu and Kashmir as well as Ladakh.
Some analysts view the 2024 elections in Kashmir as a referendum on those 2019 moves, which the BJP claimed had widespread support in the disputed region. So why did the party not field candidates in the Kashmir valley?
Al Jazeera spoke to more than a dozen residents and experts in the Kashmir Valley to try to answer this question. One key thread emerged: Everyday Kashmiris are still angry with with BJP’s decision to scrap the region’s special status and order a subsequent security crackdown that saw thousands of people arrested.
The local administration run from New Delhi has also clamped down on free speech, arresting journalists and shutting down news sites critical of the federal government. High unemployment, power shortages and a lack of basic infrastructure plague the region, and many Kashmiris say these issues remain unaddressed.
 

 
While some of the people Al Jazeera spoke with said this anger would be reflected in Kashmir’s election results, others revealed they would not bother to vote at all. “I will abstain from voting as none of the issues facing people have been addressed,” 33-year-old Saqib, a resident of Baramulla in northern Kashmir, told Al Jazeera.
“I have a PhD in social sciences but earn a meagre $200 monthly from a private teaching job. What do I vote for when there is little hope?” Saqib, who did not want his full name disclosed for fear of retribution, said.
“If anyone is excited about this election exercise, it is the loyal voter base of different political parties and their workers,” he said, referring to the pro-Indian Kashmir-based parties such as the National Conference (NC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The NC and the PDP have also been targets of crackdowns by the Modi government.
Syed Aga Ruhulla, the NC candidate from Srinagar, told Al Jazeera that the election was an opportunity for Kashmiri voters “to express their dissent”.
“They have to show they don’t accept it,” he said, referring to the anger against the unilateral decision to revoke Article 370.
He said people feel disfranchised because the state legislature has been suspended since 2019, so Kashmiris have no local government and, therefore, little say in the governance of this ecologically sensitive region.
Kashmiris fear their land and culture are under attack. Article 370 had barred outsiders from buying land and settling in Kashmir but with that safeguard gone, many fear the BJP might try to engineer a demographic shift in the region.
The “BJP knows that if it contests in Kashmir, the election will become a referendum of sorts on Article 370, and it will land the party in an embarrassing position”, Muhammad, a political analyst based in Kashmir who did not want his full name used, told Al Jazeera.
Last month, Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah said during an election rally in Jammu that the BJP wants to win the hearts of the people and is in no rush “to see the lotus [its party symbol] bloom in the [Kashmir] Valley”.
The BJP has not won any of the three Kashmir seats – Srinagar, Baramulla and Anantnag-Rajouri – since it started running in 1996. Srinagar votes on May 13, Baramulla on May 20, and Anantnag-Rajouri on May 25.
Until recently, it looked like the BJP would look to compete in Kashmir. Just two months ago, days before the national election was announced, Modi visited Srinagar, the region’s biggest city, for the first time since the 2019 scrapping of Article 370.
“I am working hard to win your hearts, and my attempt to keep winning your hearts will continue,” Modi said.
The BJP government passed a law in parliament that offers affirmative action in jobs to a mountain-dwelling tribe, in a move that sparked tensions in the region and led to accusations that Modi and his team were trying to polarise Kashmiri society to win the loyalty of select communities.
The party, should, in theory, also have been a beneficiary of gerrymandering in some constituencies: Parts of two districts from the Hindu-majority Jammu region were added to the Anantnag constituency.
So, what changed?
Analysts such as Muhammad argue that the BJP realised it does not stand a chance in the election, especially if local parties such as the NC and PDP were able to rally their support base.
However, Ashok Kaul, a senior BJP leader in the region, defended the move to not contest the election in Kashmir.
[The] “BJP already contested in two seats [from the Jammu region]”, Kaul said.
He also said that federal rule over Kashmir, under Modi, had transformed the region for the better.
“There are no shutdowns now, children attend school regularly and no one issues protest calendars. The young men no longer throw stones. Our work speaks for itself.”
Kaul was referring to the eruption of street protests in the 2010s when Kashmiri youth pelted security forces with stones in response to civilian killings. Hundreds of Kashmiris were blinded when the security forces responded with pellet guns to suppress the protests.
The BJP has emerged as a dominant player in the Jammu region in the past decade as Jammu and Kashmir’s politics have been polarised along religious and regional lines.
Voting has already taken place for the two seats in the Hindu-majority Jammu region [Jammu and Udhampur], both of which the BJP won in 2014 and 2019.
The NC, which has been the ruling party for most of the time since the region’s accession into India, and the PDP are the main players in the Kashmir Valley, while the Indian National Congress and the BJP enjoy influence in Jammu.
The NC and the PDP are part of the Congress-led opposition INDIA bloc, which is challenging the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) federally. However, both these regional constituents of the INDIA coalition are competing against each other in Kashmir.
The Apni Party and the People’s Conference, two other parties running in Kashmir, have faced accusations from critics that they are proxies for the BJP – an allegation they deny.
One of the main claims made by the BJP regarding the abrogation of Article 370 was that it would eradicate “terrorism” and improve the region’s security situation. However, attacks have continued in the region.
While the Kashmir Valley, historically a hotbed of rebellion, has experienced a decline in attacks, the rebels have gradually shifted their base to peripheral districts, such as Rajouri and Poonch in the Jammu region. These districts have witnessed a surge in rebel attacks since 2021.
Overall, however, the region has seen a significant reduction in casualties among civilians and security forces.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the number of security force casualties has declined over the past five years from 80 in 2019 to 33 in 2023. Likewise, civilian deaths have declined from 44 in 2019 to 12 in 2023.
But residents in Indian-administered Kashmir say their development-related woes continue. For the past several weeks, Kashmir has seen extended hours of electrical outages, making it the worst power crisis in years.
Kashmir’s unemployment rate stands at 18.5 percent, according to official figures, against the national average of 7.6 percent. Kashmiris are mostly reliant on government jobs, which have shrunk since the 2019 changes and are now also open to outsiders.
A proposed railway line has triggered protests from apple farmers in the Shopian district, who fear that it would result in the destruction of apple orchards and rob the local people of their livelihoods in a region where horticulture is the mainstay of the economy.
“We need development that also thinks about the welfare of locals and is done in consultation with the Indigenous people,” said Shabiya Rashid, a scholar at a local university.
Kashmir has been without a democratically elected government since 2019, and bureaucrats sent by New Delhi run the region of 12 million people.
“Who do we approach for the local issues? There is no one,” Ubaid Ahmad, a resident of Srinagar, told Al Jazeera.
Last year, the Supreme Court ordered the government to conduct elections for the state assembly by September this year.
“Any assembly election cannot be delayed for more than six months, but there have been no elections for the last six years. This is a violation of the constitution and law, indicating that the democracy the state boasts of does not extend to Kashmir,” NC leader Ruhulla said.
MW Malla, a New Delhi-based Kashmiri researcher, pointed out that the central government conducted elections even at the peak of the rebellion in Kashmir in the 1990s, when separatists called for a boycott.
Still, even without an elected regional administration, many Kashmiris like Mushkoor Ahmad, a Srinagar resident, view the national election with hope.
“It is an important election for our collective identity,” he said. “I just hope that when the results are out on June 4, it signals an end to our misery.”

India is bracing itself for the fourth phase of its weeks-long elections on May 13 to elect 96 members of parliament to the Lok Sabha, or the lower house of parliament, as the world’s largest electoral exercise moves into its final month.
The two main contenders for power are Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of 26 parties led by the main opposition party, Rahul Gandhi‘s Indian National Congress.
Last week, the third phase of the voting saw Modi cast his vote in Gujarat’s Gandhinagar constituency. It also saw the competition between the two main contenders heighten as the Congress Party’s former President Sonia Gandhi said Modi and the BJP were focusing “only on gaining power at any cost”.
The fourth phase also features a bit of glamour in the east of the country, where Bollywood veteran Shatrughan Sinha is seeking re-election in West Bengal’s Asansol, and to the south, where actress Maadhavi Latha from the BJP is standing for the Hyderabad seat in Telangana. Latha is pitted against Asaduddin Owaisi, a four-time MP from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party.

The first three phases of the election, which were held on April 19, April 26 and May 7, saw a voter turnout of 66.1, 66.7, and 61 percent, respectively. The voting so far has been lower than in the 2019 elections. In total, 969 million people are registered to vote in 543 parliamentary constituencies across 36 states and federally-governed union territories.
Registered voters across nine states and a union territory will cast their ballots for the following constituencies:
Hyderabad (Telangana): Asaduddin Owaisi is being challenged by the BJP’s Maadhavi Latha in his family bastion. Owaisi’s brother, Akbaruddin Owaisi is a member of the state legislative assembly while his father, Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi, represented the parliamentary constituency, with a substantial Muslim population, six times. Owaisi pitches himself as the voice of India’s Muslim minority whose issues he regularly raises in his parliamentary debates. Owaisi was given the “best parliamentarian” award in 2022.
Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir): This constituency in Kashmir registered just 15 percent voting in the 2019 election, which was marred by a boycott. This is the first parliamentary election in Kashmir since the region’s special status was removed in August 2019. The two biggest mainstream pro-India parties in the region – the National Conference and People’s Democratic Party – have fielded Aga Syed and Waheed Parra, respectively, as their candidates.
 

 
Krishnanagar, Baharampur and Asansol (West Bengal): These three parliamentary contests in West Bengal state, bordering Bangladesh, offer a mix of star power and political significance. Bollywood actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha is seeking re-election from Asansol, while ex-cricketer Yusuf Pathan is taking on senior Congress Party leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who has been representing Bahrampur since 1999. Chowdhury was also the leader of the opposition Congress Party in the outgoing Lok Sabha. Pathan is the candidate of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the party that rules the state and is also aligned with the national opposition INDIA alliance – even though the coalition’s members are standing against each other in West Bengal.
Yet, the most high-profile electoral battle in the state on May 13, is in Krishnanagar, where the fiery TMC parliamentarian and fierce critic of Modi, Mahua Moitra, is seeking a second term. A former vice president of JPMorgan Chase based in London, Moitra entered politics in 2009. Her parliamentary speeches asking tough questions of the government often go viral. In December 2023, the firebrand MP was expelled from parliament after being accused of accepting cash to ask questions. She said her expulsion was a way to silence her. She has challenged her expulsion in the Supreme Court. The BJP has fielded Amrita Roy, whose husband is a descendant of the erstwhile king of the region, against Moitra.
Kannauj and Lakhimpur Kheri (Uttar Pradesh): Akhilesh Yadav, the leader of the Samajwadi Party – a regional powerhouse that has seen its influence shrink with the BJP’s rise – has decided to enter the electoral race in Kannauj in northern Uttar Pradesh state, which accounts for 80 seats in the parliament. The BJP currently governs the state. Kannauj, known for its perfume industry, has been a Yadav family bastion. Akhilesh, his father Mulayan Singh Yadav and his wife Dimple Yadav have represented the seat since 1999. But in 2019, Dimple lost to the BJP in a shock defeat. Akhilesh’s entry into the electoral fray is an attempt to wrest back the family pocket borough.
The other seat that has attracted a lot of attention is Lakhimpur Kheri, where controversial federal Minister of Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni is seeking re-election. Mishra has been caught in a storm since his son Ashish Mishra allegedly ran his car over farmers protesting against now-repealed farm laws. Ashish is out on bail and farmers’ groups as well as activists have been demanding that Mishra be denied a ticket by the BJP.
Indore (Madhya Pradesh): This constituency, a stronghold of the BJP, has been in the news for unlikely reasons. The Congress candidate Akshay Kanti Bam withdrew from the race at the last minute, after the last date for candidates to file nominations had passed. The Congress could not field a replacement and Bam later joined the BJP. Thirteen other candidates are in the fray, but the Congress Party has urged voters to opt for NOTA (none of the above) in protest.
 

 
Voting will begin at 7am local time (01:30 GMT) and end at 6pm (12:30 GMT). Voters already in the queue by the time polls close will get to vote, even if that means keeping polling stations open longer.
Complete election results for all phases are to be released on June 4.

 
The first three phases of the Lok Sabha elections have already decided the fate of 284 MPs.
So far, voting has concluded for all seats in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Meghalaya, Assam, Manipur, Karnataka, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura; the Andaman and Nicobar islands; and the Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman, Diu, Lakshadweep and Puducherry union territories.
The fifth phase will kick off on May 20 and the sixth on May 25, before the election heads towards the seventh and final phase on June 1.

Indian President Droupadi Murmu and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar were among the early voters in the nation’s capital. “We want people to vote in huge numbers as the country is making a very big decision,” Jaishankar told the media after casting his ballot.
The parliamentary election, which will determine the next government, has been plagued by low voter turnout amid a heatwave and record temperatures in several parts of the country. Overall, around 970 million Indians are eligible to vote.
Rahul and Sonia Gandhi, the leaders of the Indian National Congress, the biggest opposition party in India, also cast their votes in the capital on Saturday. “Mother and I contributed to this great festival of democracy by casting our votes,” Rahul wrote in a caption to a selfie of the two on X (formerly Twitter).
In the post, he also reiterated the Congress’ pre-election promises, including jobs for 300,000 young people and a monthly payment of 8,500 India rupees ($102) for poor women, and ridding farmers of debt. Gandhi is running from two constituencies: Wayanad in Kerala and his family’s fortress of Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was released on bail earlier this month to campaign in the election, was another prominent leader who voted in the capital. “I voted against dictatorship, unemployment and inflation,” Kejriwal said after casting his vote.
Kejriwal is the co-founder and leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, which is in power in the Delhi region (the Indian capital has its own legislative assembly and elected government). The politician was arrested in April in an alleged corruption case linked to liquor tax policy. On May 10, the Supreme Court granted Kejriwal temporary bail. He will have to surrender and return to jail on June 2, the day after the six-week election wraps up.

Apart from the nation’s capital, polling is also being held in the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Haryana.
Meanwhile, turmoil has once again been reported in West Bengal, which is ruled by the All Indian Trinamool Congress party. The ruling party’s workers allegedly blocked the car of Agnimitra Paul, a BJP candidate, as she proceeded to vote in the Medinipur constituency, causing clashes, according to Indian media.
The seventh and final round of voting will be held on June 1, and the results declared on June 4.

"{'id': 'rt', 'name': 'RT'}",RT,Trans Democracy: Five transgender candidates in India’s 2024 election seek to win back the respect they had millenia ago,"Non-binaries existed in Indian mythology and ancient texts, but colonial law made them outcasts Read Full Article at RT.com",https://www.rt.com/india/597965-five-transgender-contestants-india/,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/664cbc1285f540566253bd75.jpg,2024-05-22T03:33:39Z,"In the ongoing seven-phase parliamentary election to determine whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will get a third term, India’s 970 million voters include over 48,000 transgender people.
And of the 8,039 candidates nationwide – a four-fold rise from 1,874 in the 1952 election, India’s first – three candidates are transgender; a fourth dropped out. And a fifth is hoping to sit in the state assembly of Andhra Pradesh in south India, for which voting was on May 13.
India has long had a tolerance for transgender persons, however this has nothing to do with the Western LGBTQ+ movement – indeed, Indians are merely trying to overcome the colonial-era laws that tried to stamp out its own ancient traditions on the 'third gender'.
The transgender community comprises Hijras, eunuchs, Kothis, Aravanis, Jogappas, Shiv-Shakthis, and more. Evidence for the existence of third-gender people can be found in Hindu holy texts like the Ramayana and Mahabharata.
In Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, and further back in Vedic culture, three genders were recognized. The Vedas (1500 BCE to 500 BCE) describe individuals as one of three categories according to one’s nature (‘prakrti’). These are also spelled out in the Kama Sutra (c. 4th century AD) and elsewhere as pums-prakrtistri-prakrti (female nature), and tritiya-prakrti (third-nature).
Various texts suggest that ‘third sex’ individuals were known in pre-modern India and included male-bodied or female-bodied people as well as intersexual. Third sex is also discussed in ancient Hindu law, medicine, linguistics, and astrology.
Indian linguist Patanjali’s work on Sanskrit grammar, the Mahabhaya (200 BCE), states that Sanskrit’s three grammatical genders are derived from three natural genders.
The earliest Tamil grammar, the Tolkappiyam (3rd century BCE) also refers to hermaphrodites as a third ‘neuter’ gender (in addition to a feminine category of unmasculine males). In the Puranas, there are also references to three kinds of devas of music and dance: apsaras (female), Gandharvas (male), and kinnars (neuter).
In the Vishnu Purana (orally composed during the 1st millennium BCE), the God Vishnu changes form to become Mohini (enchantress) to fool a group of demons into giving up their elixir.
In the Ramayana (300 BCE), when Lord Rama goes into exile in the forest, the hijras of Ayodhya follow him. In the Mahabharata (400 BCE), there are several instances: in one, the God Krishna, becomes a woman to spend a warrior’s last night with him. The fierce warrior-king Arjuna spends a year in hiding as a female dancing instructor. A warrior Shikhandini changes her sex to become a man, and in battle kills the patriarch Bhishma (who doesn’t put up a fight because she was ‘born a woman’).
Hijras played a famous role in the royal courts of the Islamic world, particularly in the Ottoman empire and the Mughal rule in Medieval India. They rose to become political advisors, administrators, generals as well as guardians of the harems. Hijras were considered clever, trustworthy, and fiercely loyal and had access to all the population, thereby playing a crucial role in the politics of the Mughal era.
At the beginning of the British Raj, hijras accepted protections and benefits from some Indian states through entry into the hijra community.
From the 18th century onwards, the situation changed drastically. In the second half of the 19th century, the British colonial administration vigorously sought to criminalize the hijra community and deny them civil rights. Hijras were considered to be separate castes or tribes in different parts of India by the colonial administration.
The Criminal Tribes Act, of 1871, included all hijra who were concerned with kidnapping and castrating children and dressed like women to dance in public places. The punishment was up to two years imprisonment and a fine or both. This era has made the hijra as vulnerable as they appear in the contemporary world. Though the Act was repealed in 1952, its legacy continues. Many local laws reflect prejudicial attitudes against certain tribes, including against hijras.

“Most transgender people are not able to fight for their rights as they are not educated,” says Rajan Singh, a non-binary contestant in the South Delhi Lok Sabha (lower house) constituency that votes on May 25. Singh is currently undergoing the process of gender reassignment surgery.
“I don’t have a personal aim,” Singh continues. “I want to fight for my community to live by upholding our identity. That fight is the core of my life.”
Besides Rajan Singh, for whom a court recently ordered police protection, the candidates include:
Durga Bai Majhwar, an independent ‘kinnar’ (transgender) candidate in the Damoh constituency of Madhya Pradesh (in central India), which voted on April 26. Durga’s opponents are Rahul Lodhi of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the main opposition Congress party’s Sarwar Singh Lodhi.
Then there is Sunaina Singh in Dhanbad, a coal-mining center in Jharkhand, east India. Sunaina is fighting the BJP’s Dulu Mahato and the Congress’s Anupama Singh, and voting is on May 25.
Mahamandaleshwar (the title for a monk) Hemangi Sakhi, was contemplating a challenge to Modi in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh (UP), India’s most populous state. Varanasi votes on June 1.
The transgender monk is from the far-right Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, an outfit that is older than the nationalist paramilitary Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP’s parent organization. However, Sakhi has been persuaded not to contest after BJP leaders gave an assurance that they would make Modi aware of the concerns of transgender persons. 
The only non-parliamentary candidate is Tamanna Simhadri, who is contesting the Pithapuram assembly seat in Andhra Pradesh on behalf of the pro-dalit Bharatiya Chaitanya Yuvajana Party. (Dalits sit at the bottom of India’s unique caste pyramid.)
Tamanna’s main opponents are movie-star-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan, whose Janasena Party is allied with the BJP in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and Vanga Geetha of the YSR Congress Party (which is the incumbent state ruling party). Voting took place on May 13.
Tamanna is a trans woman, having undergone gender reassignment surgery.

A ‘transgender’ is a person who no longer identifies with their gender assigned at birth. Those who choose change through surgery or hormones may identify as transsexual.
‘Gender-neutral’ refers to individuals or groups without implying maleness or femaleness.
A ‘eunuch’ is a castrated human male.
The ‘hijra’community is the most common ‘third gender’ in South Asia, though their identity is complex. They are often born male but look and dress in a feminine way. Some hijras are born intersex. Not all prefer the castration ceremony.
Hijras are also known by different names in different communities as Kinnar, Jogtas/Jogappas and Khusras. They number an estimated four million. UP has the most: around 5% of its population.
’Hermaphrodites’have both male and female reproductive organs.
India’s transgender population has a literacy rate of 56.07%, but India has never had a transgender member of parliament.
“In 77 years of independence, we have been fighting to enter Parliament, to empower ourselves,” Rajan Singh, Delhi’s first-ever neuter-gender candidate, told RT. “Our representation is zero because we have never been brought into the mainstream. Even at 1% reservation there would be six of us in the Lok Sabha.”
Singh (26) is a postgraduate degree holder in Hindi Literature. He was estranged from his family after he ‘came out’ young, and has been supported by political activists. “We are treated as untouchable,” Singh says. “People don’t want to touch us, or marry us. There is no facility for us in the education system.”
But most transgender persons don’t fight for their rights because they’re not educated. “The Constitution has given everyone equal rights,” Singh says. “Those rights would get us back our self-esteem and identity. This is a fight for justice, power, and identity.”
Singh claims a threat to life, therefore the court order for police protection, as a rival party is hostile. “They hate us and body-shame us,” Singh says. “How many votes I get would be a stamp on my identity, self-esteem, and the fact that we are alive.”
Durga Bai Majhwar (36) was elected India’s first transgender village head (sarpanch) of Kanhwara in Madhya Pradesh, in 2014. 
“The people persuaded me to fight elections,” Durga tells RT. “The response was warm, people were happy for a third candidate in the fray as they were disappointed with the other two. They got a new face and blessed me because I am a transgender.”
Durga Bai did not attend school or receive a formal education, but believes that won’t stand in the way. Her family has been supportive. “In the village, I tried to address poverty by providing financial support to build houses, toilets and roads, and address drinking water availability,” Durga Bai says.
Mahamandaleshwar Hemangi Sakhi’s reason for contesting the election is her party’s direction. She also contested the 2017 UP assembly polls. “I identify with my party’s political objectives,” Sakhi tells RT. The people’s response, she says, was positive. 
According to reports, Sakhi was appointed Acharya Mahamandaleshwar in February 2019, and honoured with the title of Bhagwatbhushan Mahamandaleshwar by the Akhil Bharatiya Sadhu Samaj (literally, All India Priests Society). Sakhi has also acted in films and on TV.
Sunaina Singh (35) filed the nomination from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, accompanied by nearly a dozen transgender people dancing and singing traditional songs. “I am Dhanbad’s daughter and have massive public support. I know their problems. I will fight for jobs for the third-gender community,” Sunaina told media persons.
This zoology graduate represents the UP-based Naqi Bhartiya Ekta Party (NBEP), and is district president of the ‘Kinnar (transgender) Mas Trust’.

“There are educated people among us with a decent lifestyle. I want to tell society to change its way of looking at us,” Tamanna (35) told RT.
Tamanna is a TV actor who participated in, among other things, the Telugu edition of the Indian reality show ‘Big Boss’. A graduate in Computer Applications, she was the first trans woman to contest assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh in 2019.
The 35-year-old trans woman is overwhelmed with people’s love during the campaign. “I am surprised,” Tamanna says. “People come forward and talk to me.”
She sees change slowly happening. “Those who earlier used to clap hands at traffic signals (to solicit money) have now got jobs at the municipal corporation,” Tamanna says.

The legacy of English jurisprudence caused problems for earlier transgender candidates. Two winners of elections – Kamla Jaan as mayor of Katni, Madhya Pradesh, in 1999; and Asha Devi (born as Amarnath Yadav) as mayor of Gorakhpur, UP, in 2000 – saw their terms ended mid-way when the courts ruled they were originally men and could not win constituencies ‘reserved’ for women. (Reservations of seats in the legislative assemblies, as well as in government jobs and educational institutions are common in India in pursuit of social justice.)
Other early winners included Madhya Pradesh electing the first transgender person, Shabnam Mausi, to the assembly in 2000. Her luck did not hold out when she fought the Kanpur seat in UP in 2012. She again contested the 2018 Madhya Pradesh elections along with five other transgender candidates.
In April 2014, India’s Supreme Court ruled that transgender persons have a right to be legally recognized according to their self-identified gender, including a third gender. Days after the judgment, a transgender person tried for a parliamentary seat. Bharathi Kannamma was the candidate from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state.
Then, Madhu Bai Kinnar, a transgender woman became the first openly transgender mayor in Raigarh in the state of Chhattisgarh, in 2015. In 2019, M Radha contested from Mylapore, Chennai in Tamil Nadu, and again in the 2021 assembly election with the support of crowdfunding but lost.
Five others, including Bhawani Nath Singh Valmiki of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Kajal of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and independent Aswathi Rajappan also contested the 2019 polls. 
In December 2022, a transgender person Bobi was elected to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on an AAP ticket. Devika Akka and Sudha M won in the Karnataka local body elections in 2020. Chithrapu Pushpita Laya from the community was the BSP candidate from Warangal East in Telangana in 2023.
Kalki Subramaniam is an Indian transgender activist, a queer artist, and the founder of Sahodari Foundation, that works for the Indian transgender population. She says political parties are becoming inclusive.
“But they actually give importance to transgender people in the election manifesto only,” Kalki tells RT. “Promises are made but actions are happening slowly or not at all. The struggle is the same, though in some areas it has been better.”
She suggests that governments should focus not solely on giving identity cards and introducing schemes to the queer community, but also on providing legal rights, rehabilitating community members, and making it family-inclusive.
“Many transgender people drop out of school and hence they should get orientation towards entrepreneurship,” Kalki says. “But governments are not into it.”
Having representatives in electoral bodies, she believes, will bring change, and more people from the community should enter politics.

The roots of the revolt against Narendra Modi’s government were visible to anyone who cared to look.
Narendra Modi speaks to members of the media outside the President’s House in New Delhi, India, on Friday, June 7, 2024.
“Ab ki baar, chaar so paar!” Over the last six months, millions of Bharatiya Janata (Indian People’s) Party (BJP) supporters reveled in their party’s official slogan for the 2024 Indian parliamentary elections, bellowing it at rallies and meetings across the country. The phrase roughly translates to “This time around, we’ll get over 400 seats!”—a swaggering proclamation that radiated inevitability.
In the run-up to the election, the BJP’s preening seemed at least somewhat justified. The 400+ goal felt audacious, but always felt possible—at times, even certain. The party’s electoral coalition emerged out of the last parliamentary election in 2019 with 352 seats (303 for the BJP alone)—a powerful mandate in the 543-seat chamber that put 400 seats within close reach. Polls pointed to another decisive victory, giving even more ballast to the slogan. And, most of all, at the helm of the BJP sits Narendra Modi, who’s among the most charismatic, magnetic, and indomitable politicians that India has ever seen.
Much has been written about Modi’s decade as prime minister. His Hindu nationalist politics, which has turned hundreds of millions of Indian Muslims into targets of the state, are well-known, as is his evisceration of Indian civil society. It’s clear what a third consecutive landslide win would have facilitated: an era of unipolar, one-party politics, where Modi’s already significant capture of state institutions would deepen to the extent that BJP machinery became fully indistinguishable from everyday bureaucratic governance. It would have been a tripling down on the repression that has become so normalized throughout Indian society: more opposition political leaders and journalists thrown into jail; more state-sanctioned vigilante violence targeting religious, caste, and cultural minorities; more capture of bureaucratic institutions; and more crackdowns on dissenting speech.
This grim scenario began to seem like a reality on June 1, with the official release of exit polls. Numerous polls promised a remarkable showing for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the electoral coalition headed by the BJP. Almost all of them had the NDA surpassing the 350-seat mark, and some even had the group edging close to 400. All of India’s mainstream news channels (which have effectively devolved into mouthpieces for the BJP) went into a manic frenzy—casting aside any pretense of objectivity and adopting a tone of open celebration. Slowly, the news of the exit polls reached Western media outlets, who rushed to forecast a thumping reelection victory for the prime minister and his party.
But when official vote counts began trickling in on June 4, it became clear that the exit polls had been wildly incorrect (some have even alleged that exit poll manipulation took place). One pollster broke down sobbing on national television over the scale of his firm’s errors.
As it turned out, the BJP wasn’t going to add 100 seats to its coalition. The party was actually hemorrhaging seats across the country—most shockingly, in constituencies across its strongholds in the north in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana. The BJP ultimately lost 63 seats, ending up with 240. For the first time since coming to office in 2014, the party lacked an absolute majority, meaning that it would have to depend on its NDA allies to form a coalition government. Now, the NDA alliance sits at 293 seats. Meanwhile, INDIA, the electoral alliance led by the Congress Party, the left-of-center, secular, national opposition party, exceeded all expectations, netting 246 seats.
The eulogies for Indian democracy delivered in the weeks and months leading to the election now feel premature, even absurd. The Indian democratic project appears more robust and resilient than many people anticipated, and its voters rebuked the illiberal, one-party abyss presented by the BJP. Even though the cult of Modi and the specter of Hindu nationalism remain far from vanquished, they have suffered a significant, historic loss.
Even as Modi’s aura of invincibility remained pristine from afar, some close observers of Indian politics maintained that a landslide reelection victory was far from guaranteed. One point of evidence seemed to be the BJP’s inability to mobilize the grassroots zeal that powered it to victory in the previous two parliamentary elections. While the last two election cycles featured a raucous base of BJP supporters and an energized party machinery, this election season was characterized by a palpable silence, both among voters and Hindu nationalist footsoldiers. But mainstream news outlets, which remained captured by pro-Modi forces, rarely confronted BJP leaders with any serious or rigorous questioning of their party’s organizational difficulties during the campaign.
Historically, the BJP has relied on volunteers from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteer Organization, RSS) to carry out much of the legwork of campaigning. The RSS is a century-old, pan-Indian paramilitary group, influenced by the ideologies of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, that boasts millions of members (some call it the largest volunteer organization in the world) to proselytize the Hindu nationalist cause. The RSS has been implicated in fomenting numerous instances of mob violence over the last seven decades (it’s even been banned from India on three occasions), and it anchors an entire network of Hindu nationalist organizations, including women’s groups, youth groups, labor unions, and overseas chapters. The BJP was spawned out of the RSS as its political wing, and Modi himself has been in the RSS since he was a child.
Modi remains beloved by vast swaths of Hindu nationalists, but his swelling stature has created friction between the BJP and the RSS—the former an organization whose leadership has largely been filled by Modi’s inner circle, and the latter a rigidly ideological organization, whose cultural mission of Hindu supremacy takes precedence over any single individual. Power struggles between the Modi circle and RSS leadership have brewed for years, and spilled out into the open this election season. In an interview conducted last month, BJP President J.P. Nadda, a close Modi ally, shocked political observers when he openly stated what had, until then, been acknowledged only by insinuation: “In the beginning we would have been less capable, smaller and needed the RSS. Today, we have grown and we are capable. The BJP runs itself.”
This lack of grassroots support among party workers and loyalists must also be contextualized with a broader resentment held by rural Indians, especially in the north. Unemployment has soared in recent years; the economy has languished while wealth inequality soars; educational opportunities have dwindled; social welfare systems haven’t been able to deliver as promised. After a full decade in office, there is little room for the prime minister to evade responsibility for the national government’s shortcomings. In many constituencies across India, races became localized referendums on the current state of life in India.
Ever the nimble politician, Modi deployed familiar tactics to try to nationalize the election. Most notably, he injected brazenly majoritarian, anti-Muslim rhetoric into his campaigning. Though his anti-Muslim politics are well-known, Modi as prime minister has typically deployed dog whistles rather than open hate speech—but his tenor shifted sharply during this election season. During one speech in Rajasthan, he chillingly described Muslims as “infiltrators” who “have more children” and accused them of disproportionately collecting government benefits. Days later, during another speech, he accused opposition leaders of performing mujra—a Mughal-era dance historically performed by courtesans—to curry favor with Muslim voters. To some, these crass proclamations could be interpreted as indicating overconfidence, a certainty of victory that allowed him to present his politics entirely unmediated. But to others, this change in tone revealed a new sense of desperation.
Though large portions of the Indian public subscribe to Modi’s breed of Hindu nationalism, for millions of Indians these ideological commitments pale in comparison to the anger elicited by the BJP’s failures to govern. These failures rarely received any media attention from mainstream outlets, which all prostrated to the BJP in portraying the prime minister as both invincible and infallible. Only thanks to the nation’s burgeoning independent-media ecosystem did these sorts of stories get any traction. Modi’s attempt to divert attention away from the material deficiencies of everyday life and toward this greater ideological battle fell flat.
Perhaps the best example of this may be seen in the grand Ram Mandir (RamaTemple) in the north Indian city of Ayodhya, which opened in January of this year. The city has become a site of holy pilgrimage over the last few centuries, owing to the myth that the Hindu deity Rama was born there thousands of years ago. The temple was constructed on the ruins of a mosque destroyed by Hindu nationalist paramilitaries (working in tandem with BJP politicians) in 1992, in an event that helped supercharge the Hindu nationalist political movement. When Modi, the head of state of an ostensibly secular nation, presided over the temple’s consecration in January of this year, hundreds of millions of Indians celebrated. The temple was seen as a grand, shining monument to Modi’s Hindu supremacist India—one that not only legitimated but also sanctified majoritarian mob violence.
On the ground, however, the construction of the temple drew the ire of residents in Ayodhya. Many had their homes seized and destroyed by the government, and were either given meager compensation or lackluster dwellings on the outskirts of the city. The slums that surrounded the temple largely remained undeveloped, and for many locals the temple became a symbol not of a triumphant Hindu identity but of a government preoccupied by its own performance of grandeur, at the expense of the poor. Last week, voters in Ayodhya’s parliamentary constituency shocked the nation when they voted out their BJP representative. Constituencies across India did the same.
This, of course, is just a brief snapshot of certain themes that colored this election—a more complete analysis would consider other factors, such as shifting caste allegiances, evolving party politics at the state and regional levels, and the roles of competing regional and cultural chauvinisms. It will take months, if not years, to sift through the data of the 640 million votes cast—and even then, India is too large and heterogenous for easy answers. “There is no single overarching explanation that would apply to this election,” one analyst has asserted. “Any theory that you’re going to come up with won’t be applicable in a neighboring state.”
But coming out of last week, there are certain things that we can definitively say. For one, even as this rightly feels like a victory for Modi’s opponents, his party remains the strongest force in Indian politics. BJP vote shares spiked in southern states, such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, areas that have historically been resistant to the BJP’s brand of politics but in recent years have received enormous investments from the party—now, they seem poised to break through in those states’ upcoming assembly elections. The BJP also emerged victorious in the eastern state of Odisha, routing the incumbent regional Biju Janata Dal (Biju People’s Party) from Parliament, now holding 20 of the state’s 21 seats. The BJP’s losses in the north (as well as in Maharashtra and West Bengal) shouldn’t necessarily be taken as a rejection of Hindu nationalism. The ideology is alive and well, and will continue its long march throughout the country.

Still, this result is undoubtedly a setback for Modi’s regime, which, for the first time, will have to rely on other parties to stay in power. Modi’s fiat to rule will now have a real check, and his government, with just a 21-seat majority, can’t afford any reckless overreach. One wrong move may cause the departure of coalition allies (most of whom aren’t doctrinal Hindu nationalists), which could humiliatingly topple the NDA government. This dilution of BJP’s mandate should also enable a reinvigoration of Indian civil society, which has languished under a decade of suppression. Activist groups and NGOs have been routinely punished over the last decade for their advocacy, especially when they criticize government policy—this will likely change in a freer political environment. Media outlets, as well, will hopefully feel emboldened to report stories without fear of state reprisal.
Most of all, this electoral performance has punctured Modi’s aura of invincibility. It has given his opponents the confidence to challenge Modi and the BJP head-on. Even as key leaders of the opposing electoral alliance sat in jail on trumped-up charges, and even as Congress Party bank accounts were frozen during the election season, the opposition still managed to put forth a strong performance by drawing attention to the BJP’s failed policies (and tapping into the anti-incumbency sentiments that often attach to governing parties after so many years in power). The opposition coalition, the INDIA Alliance, is a sprawling, unwieldy political configuration, one composed of dozens of parties (many of whom have bitterly fought one another over the years). The INDIA Alliance’s challenge, now, will be to remain united as it proposes an alternative to the hostile, exclusionary consensus championed by the BJP.
A return to the pre-Modi status quo won’t suffice—after all, it’s that status quo that birthed the explosion of strongman Hindu nationalism. Opposition leaders in politics and civil society must go far beyond that and put forth an expansive vision for India that guarantees economic and social justice for all, across caste, class, and religious lines. Indian voters rejected the fatalism that the rest of the world projected onto their nation, and they wrested away their political system from an authoritarian chokehold. Now, the opposition must meet the voters’ mandate.

      Czech-born British playwright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard had aptly noted, “…it’s not the voting that’s democracy. It’s the counting..."". Counting of votes for the Lok Sabha elections is still on, but the current trend so far suggests the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) is all set to form the next government in New Delhi. It is also certain that the government that will be sworn in soon in New Delhi will definitely be a Majboor Sarkar (weak government) rather than a Majboot Sarkar (strong government). Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) founder Kanshiram firmly believed that such a weak government would always be more accountable and answerable towards the people of a developing country like India.

     
      Over the last 10 years that the NDA has been in power, the Opposition—which was in a disarray--has been claiming that the government was going against the very idea of India which has remained multi-lingual, multi-religious and pluralistic in civilizational sense; and a multi-party democracy and federal in constitutional sense. The Hindutva juggernaut, it said, needed to be stopped. And so there emerged a need for alliances of political parties. Such alliances have been successful, as seen in the Bihar Assembly elections in 2015. The very idea of Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) started shaping up against this backdrop. The Janata Dal United, led by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, took the initiative then and found good support from the Congress and Rashtriya Janta Dal, besides the Shiv Sena (led by Udhav Thackeray) the Nationalist Congress Party, the All India Trinamul Congress, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Communist parties.

     
      INDIA was a welcome idea, as unlike in the 2019 parliamentary elections, the opposition parties came together to take on the BJP that had seen its popularity soar and its vote percentage going up to 40%. The 2024 general election is thus unique in the sense that there was an attempt by the Opposition to cobble up a pan-India alliance.

     
      The history of Indian parliamentary democracy shows that there were two attempts by the Opposition to dethrone the ruling party, in 1977 and 1989, respectively. In both cases, the Opposition parties and their leaders were so devoted to their cause that they decided to field a single opposition candidate in each parliamentary seat. INDIA failed miserably on this count. The first jolt came when the JDU decided to part ways with the alliance. Mamata Banerjee led AITC, too, left the fledgling alliance midway. Mayawati-led BSP couldn’t be persuaded to be a part of this alliance. Also, no common minimum programme could be pronounced on behalf of the alliance. Yet, opposition unity was definitely better than in 2019 though it could not muster the support of the electorate to form a government of its own.

     
      The incumbent BJP, on the other hand, started off by setting a high target. The NDA slogan was abki bar char sau paar (400 seats this time) but it seemed to sense the pulse of the people and was pragmatic enough to enter into alliances with political parties such as the JDU and the Telugu Desam Party led by Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh. It also welcomed into its fold parties of lesser significance, including the Shiv Sena faction led by Shinde and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar, Pattali Makkal Katchi of Tamil Nadu and Janata Dal Secular of Karnataka.

     
      It requires no retelling that in the first-past-the-post system, the government is elected by only a minority of its total electorate. So, in 2014, the ruling party’s voter share was close to 31%; in 2019, it was 38%. The estimated vote percentage for BJP for 2024 is again close to 38% even if the NDA vote share would be higher and closer to 40%. This simply indicates that above 60% of the Indian electorate has never extended its mandate to the government.

     
      As for the electoral outcome, Abraham Lincoln had quipped once, ""Elections belong to the people. It's their decision. If they decide to turn their back on the fire and burn their behinds, then they will just have to sit on their blister.""

 A day before counting of votes, Bihar’s Chief Minister Nitish Kumar flew to the national capital to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top BJP leaders to discuss, among other things, the JDU’s potential inclusion in the central government as the NDA’s third consecutive term in power appears certain.
Kumar, whose party JDU is the BJP’s ruling ally in Bihar, met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi early Monday and was scheduled to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah later in the day to discuss political issues in Bihar. However, Kumar, who has been the Chief Minister of Bihar since 2005, reportedly spoke to Shah over the phone as their meeting could not take place.
With the Bihar CM facing health issues, speculation is rife over his future. The JDU, however, stated that Kumar was in Delhi for an eye check-up and had sought time as a routine from Modi and Shah.
Before walking out of the NDA, the JDU had joined the Modi government in 2021 with its leader RCP Singh becoming a Cabinet minister. At that time, the JDU wanted two cabinet berths at the Centre but had to be satisfied with only one slot.
Later, the JDU left the NDA but did a U-turn to become a BJP ally again early this year. The regional party also fought the 2024 Lok Sabha elections as part of the NDA.
This time, there was widespread speculation that one of the key topics of Kumar’s visit was the JDU joining the Modi government.
Interestingly, the JDU is demanding early polls in Bihar which, is in line with the one nation, one election plank of the BJP. The JDU wants assembly elections to be held in Bihar along with other States like Maharashtra and Haryana which are scheduled to seek public mandate later this year. It’s also demanding special status and a special package for the State as a delegation of the Finance Commission is likely to visit Patna on June 10.
Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders, such as party president JP Nadda, Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah, held a meeting on Monday to discuss the party’s performance in the Lok Sabha polls and its preparation for the counting of votes scheduled on Tuesday.
“A meeting was held to discuss and review the elections conducted in seven phases and also to discuss the counting of votes which is to take place tomorrow. The meeting was presided over by party national president J P Nadda,” BJP national general secretary Vinod Tawde told reporters. According to Tawde, voting patterns during all the seven phases of polls were “also reviewed.”
The “Extension discussions” on all seven phases of elections took place in the meeting, attended by BJP national general secretaries and secretaries. Deployment of the party’s polling agents across the country for counting of votes too came up in talks.

Bharti was named minister for law, administrative reforms, and art and culture in the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government, which lasted for just 49 days, after it won the 2013 Delhi Assembly election. The upcoming Lok Sabha election is his maiden contest the general polls.
Bansuri Swaraj, the daughter of former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, is contesting from the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat against AAP's Somnath Bharti. A lawyer by profession, Bansuri was named co-convenor of the party's Delhi legal cell and has become the face of the BJP since last year. Bansuri has been an outspoken critic of Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government for the past year, particularly Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.
Congress, under the seat sharing formula with AAP, has fielded Kanhaiya Kumar from the East Delhi constituency. The former president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU), Kanhaiya Kumar has been noticed for his aggressive campaign and sharp attacks on BJP's Manoj Tiwaro, who is pitted against him. This is Kanhaiya's second encounter with Lok Sabha polls. In 2019, he unsuccessfully contested Bihar's Begusarai seat on a CPI ticket. He joined Congress in 2021.
Manoj Tiwari is the only BJP candidate in Delhi who has been renominated by the saffron party in the Lok Sabha elections this year. His fight is against Kamhaiya Kumar of Congress, making the battle a challenging one. After defeating former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit in the 2019 elections, the Bhojpuri singer and actor, who has represented the constituency for 10 years, earned the nickname ""giant slayer."" He had won by a margin of almost 3,64,000 votes. Tiwari is also the richest candidate in Delhi Lok Sabha elections.
Kuldeep Kumar, a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), will run for the Lok Sabha from the East Delhi seat. In the 2017 Delhi municipal election, the AAP fielded him from the East Delhi ward of Kalyanpuri. At the age of 27, he became the youngest corporator in the MCD. After that, he was named vice president of the AAP's Delhi Unit and leader of the opposition in the East Delhi Municipal Corporation. In 2020, Kumar received another AAP ticket, this time for the Delhi assembly election from the Kondli (East) reserved seat. Raj Kumar of the BJP lost to him by almost 18,000 votes. This time, Kuldeep Kumar faces BJP's Harsh Malhotra.
East Delhi will have a dynamic contest as Kuldeep Kumar will face BJP's Harsh Malhotra, one of the three general secretaries of the Delhi unit of BJP. Malhotra won a seat on the council in 2012, serving as the Welcome ward representative. He later rose to the position of mayor in the East Delhi Municipal Corporation in 2015. At the same time, he became the Chairman of the EDMC Education Committee and served in that capacity for three years.

Rebelo, the deputy editor of Boom Live, a fact-checking publication based in Mumbai, is used to poring over video footage of prominent Indian political figures. But something about this particular recording of the local official, Kamal Nath, wasn’t adding up.
In the 40-second clip, Nath appears to address voters from a pulpit and says that if his party wins the upcoming state elections he plans to end the ladli behna program. The popular state welfare scheme was introduced by the opposing Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP. The comments were more than uncharacteristic, they were suspiciously favorable to the BJP’s election bid.
“I told my teammates there could be only two possibilities: either you have the world’s best impersonator, or you’re using a voice clone,” Rebelo told me on a recent WhatsApp call. “There’s no other third possibility.”
The doctored videos suggested only two scenarios – political parties had a really good voice impersonator or the use of AI voice cloning tech. Most AI audio detection tools online are highly unreliable. These videos were viral when misinfo about Israel-Hamas war exploded. (3/n) pic.twitter.com/Fanc31O0ZO
— Karen Rebelo (@Karen_Rebelo) January 20, 2024

Rebelo theorized that the clip was an audio deepfake: AI-generated audio made to convincingly mimic Nath’s voice. But she didn’t know how to prove it.
“You can no longer solely rely on your human skills as a fact checker,” she said, explaining that standard reporting strategies had fallen short in verifying the video. Synthetic media experts largely agree that the rise of widely accessible generative AI tools over the past two years — across image, audio, and video — has led to a proliferation of political deepfakes. Some of this content is sophisticated enough that a studied human eye, or ear, in combination with ordinary fact-checking methods like a reverse image search or cross-checking details, is simply not enough to debunk it.
Instead, these deepfakes require forensic analysis, often including algorithmic models that can parse through a piece of media to find signs of manipulation. But like many newsrooms in India, Rebelo’s team at Boom Live was hard-pressed to figure out which detection tools were out there and whether they’d be able to access them.
“We didn’t have a very reliable AI audio detection tool at that time. I was looking around for something. I couldn’t find anything that I could completely trust,” Rebelo recalled, remembering several dead ends she encountered running the clip through free tools on the internet. Ultimately, it took Rebelo a few months, plenty of rejected inquiries, and a cold email to the University at Buffalo professor Siwei Lyu, a continent away, to finally find someone who was willing to run a full forensic analysis of the audio clip for free.
According to Lyu’s analysis, the audio of Nath was, in fact, a fake. As were three other clips circling on social media of politicians involved in the Madhya Pradesh state elections. On January 18, Boom Live finally ran its investigation exposing the audio deepfakes. The state election, meanwhile, had been declared over a month earlier.

In recent months, newsrooms across India have been trying to build out a process for deepfake detection. As Boom Live’s Rebelo found, this often requires building relationships with academic researchers, disinformation-focused nonprofits, and developers behind commercial AI detection tools, within India and abroad. A coalition of Indian fact-checking organizations, including Boom Live, launched a WhatsApp hotline in March, called the Deepfakes Analysis Unit, to try and centralize this work of authenticating political media across the country.

The momentum has largely been fueled by anticipation, and concern, around the ongoing Indian general elections. On April 19, voting began in what is expected to be the largest election in history, with over 1 billion people eligible to go to the polls. The election is so large it is split up into several waves, the last of which will take place on June 1. Among the candidates on the ballot is incumbent Prime Minister Modi, a member of the BJP, who is seeking a third term in office.
India may hold the largest election this year, but it is far from the last. In 2024, more than 60 countries will hold major elections and over half of the world’s population will be eligible to go to the polls. In the coming weeks, Mexico and South Africa will host their own general elections, followed closely by the E.U. parliamentary elections. On November 5, the U.S. will go to the polls in a presidential race that is forecasted to, once again, be plagued by election disinformation.
While the current infrastructure for deepfake detection is being pressure tested in India right now, the reporting strategies being carved out by journalists during the election offer a preview into the challenges that lie ahead for other newsrooms around the world.
“Right now it’s manageable, because it’s one [potential deepfake] in a day. What happens when it becomes multiple things in a day? When it becomes multiple on the hour?” wondered Rebelo when we spoke in the days leading up to the first wave of voting. “The challenge will be what happens when it goes nuclear.”
So far in this Indian election cycle, academics studying synthetic media have been a critical resource for reporters like Rebelo. Among them has been Mayank Vatsa’s lab at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Jodhpur. Vatsa started seeing requests for deepfake testing from journalists trickle in last year. Quickly, that influx became a steady stream, with one or two potential deepfakes hitting his inbox every week.
Vatsa soon realized the time it took to sort through those requests and correspond with each journalist alone was unsustainable. In February, he launched Itisaar in collaboration with the Indian startup DigitID. An online web portal, Itisaar allows users to upload files directly and automates parts of the verification process. Currently, individuals can upload files for free. Now, nearly three months into the project, Itisaar is receiving one or two potential deepfakes every hour.
Despite its nascency, the platform already has over 80 approved users and roughly 40% of those are journalists. So far, he says his team has fully evaluated more than 500 submitted samples.

Itisaar can output a simple report that states, up or down, whether a piece of media is a deepfake with a percentage confidence rating. But Vatsa explains journalists often come back to him looking for more granular information, requesting comprehensive reports that they can use to bolster their fact check before running a story.
If an audio clip is one minute long, the Itisaar team can break the clip into four-second segments and mark whether those subclips have been altered. Some of the audio deepfakes they’ve analyzed take real audio recordings and splice in AI-generated segments. “We call this a half-truth,” said Vatsa.
When a journalist submits a video clip, Itisaar can break down the clip by frame and mark where in the video the authentication model is “focusing” while making decisions. If the model is focusing mostly on the lip region, that gives a cue that the mouth has been altered and there’s a very high chance the video is a lip sync, according to Vatsa. If the model focuses on one face in a group, that’s a cue the video is a face swap. “We can get this kind of interpretability, and we provide these attention maps to the journalist,” he said.
When videos of Bollywood actors Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh criticizing Modi went viral the first week of the election, Boom Live used Itisaar to test the clips. From Itisaar’s report they were able to determine the clips were made using a “voice swap,” meaning AI-generated audio had been used to overlay the fake critical comments onto real video footage. The Indian Express, NDTV, Hindustan Times and other major national news outlets aggregated Boom Live’s findings.

There are notable benefits for reporters working with local researchers in India like Vatsa. “The beauty of our approach has been, with respect to audio, that it is multilingual and, with respect to video and images, that it encompasses the diversity of skin tone in the Indian context,” said Vatsa.
One challenge in reporting on election deepfakes in India is language. National newsrooms may have the resources to closely track political disinformation in Hindi, English, or Bengali, but the same often cannot be said for all 22 official languages in India, as well as the more than 120 major regional languages spoken across the country.
Vatsa’s team at IIT Jodhpur, however, has collected a database of 4.1 million audio deepfakes to train its tools. That cuts across Hindi, English, and 13 additional languages spoken on the Indian subcontinent, including Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. The team’s deepfake video dataset, meanwhile, has more than 130,000 samples, mostly depicting Indian people.
RELATED ARTICLEDeepfake detection improves when using algorithms that are more aware of demographic diversitySiwei LyuApril 23, 2024“Data is the new oil, right? What kind of oil are you going to put in your engine?,” asked Vatsa, questioning the efficacy of detection tools that run only on English-language datasets, or that otherwise limit themselves to Western data sources. “That’s the whole game here. If I have to solve the problem, for diversity in language, in a multilingual setting, I have to only put that oil into my engine.”
Vatsa has observed the shortcomings of English-dominated deepfake detection models first hand. Last month, Itisaar received a video through its portal that was in a regional language, one most spoken in a single south Indian state. When the Itisaar team fed the video into its model trained solely on English, it said it was authentic. When they used their standard multilingual model, it correctly identified the video as a deepfake.
“I’m not contesting that a language-agnostic model can be created. Certainly, it can be,” said Vatsa. “But if you have language diversity available to you to train on, then you actually get much better performance, and higher confidence.” Currently, Vatsa claims Itisaar’s models, in almost all 15 languages it is trained on, are registering more than 80% accuracy in detecting deepfakes. In some cases, including Hindi and English, that number rises to 90 to 95%.
“Many of the tools which are available, we don’t know what technology has been used and what kind of diversity the databases have used. But their diversity — the population that they’re looking at — probably is very different from the population that I’m looking at right now,” he said.
While Itisaar is one example of the benefits of a homegrown deepfake detection tool, many reporters in India are, in practice, finding their strongest partnerships with experts abroad.
That includes Nilesh Christopher, an independent journalist based in Bangalore, who has been at the forefront of covering AI-generated political disinformation. (Christopher will also be a 2024–2025 Nieman Fellow.) Most recently, he reported a series of stories for Al Jazeera on the topic, including a piece exposing the rise of AI-generated videos of deceased Indian politicians. They are increasingly being used for posthumous election endorsements. For Wired, Christopher and Varsha Bansal reported that over 50 million AI-generated voice clone calls were made in India in the two months leading up to the elections, as part of an emerging deepfake cottage industry for voter outreach.

In a recent phone call, Christopher echoed other journalists I spoke to — finding reliable detection tools to do this work is not easy. But for Christopher, one reason has been political self-censorship.
“The Indian organizations I reached out to directly wanted to do forensic analysis off record, and tell me about it. None of them wanted to be on-record, fearing political backlash,” he told me, explaining he has encountered this problem with both AI startups and academic research labs in India.
In recent years, political journalists and fact checkers have faced increasing scrutiny and censorship by the Modi government. In 2022, the Delhi police arrested Mohammed Zubair, the founder of the prominent fact checking site Alt News, because of a social media post. More recently, the government has mandated bans of journalists on social media platforms like Twitter and begun the contentious roll-out of a centralized government fact-checking body.
“Once the startups weigh in on a specific political issue, they face the risk of the politician coming after them,” Christopher said. He describes the resistance of local Indian startups to taking on political deepfake checks, particularly on-the-record, as a “systemic issue.” 
“I’m quite confident that none of them would take up detection if it’s a very contentious high-stakes election issue,” he added, imagining an incident that had influence over an election outcome. “That hinders and pushes journalists behind in the news cycle as we try to report the truth.”
For many reporters, gaps in domestic deepfake testing have forced them to regularly seek out expertise overseas. Christopher, for one, has been working closely with Witness, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit that furthers the use of video and technology to defend human rights. Last year, Witness launched its Deepfake Rapid Response Force, an initiative that seeks to help journalists take on some of “the most difficult deepfake cases.”
For one of Christopher’s investigations, published by Rest of World in July 2023, Witness analyzed two audio clips of a politician from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The politician claimed the embarrassing clips — in which he accuses his own party officials of corruption — were AI-generated. The Deepfake Rapid Response Force was able to conduct machine tests and bring in Tamil-speaking experts to review the recordings. Ultimately, one of the clips was deemed real by several sources. The deepfake claim appeared to be a cover to save face.
Services like this, run by Western nonprofits, are critical to journalists reporting on election deepfakes in India right now, according to Christopher. But there are still significant downsides. For one, the full review by the Deepfake Rapid Response Force took about three weeks.
“As someone who is in the Global South, without easy access to these tools, even when organizations like Witness are willing to help, the time lag between when you submit a piece of evidence and you get the result is so far out,” he said, noting that even when checks are expedited, there are few academic or nonprofit partners who can get something turned around in less than a few days.
Academics I spoke to confirmed that they are being inundated with requests from journalists in India, with limited time and resources to take on these pro-bono cases. That means as the election unfolds, there is a constant need to triage which potential deepfakes get prioritized.
“I try to limit that to high-stakes situations,” said Hany Farid, a leading researcher in synthetic media at the University of California, Berkeley, who has worked closely with Indian journalists in recent months. Currently, Farid says his team can only reasonably take on one to two checks per day, despite requests coming in from all over the world.
The lab’s process isn’t as simple as pressing a button; it often requires the team members to customize their forensics approach or run a series of different tests. “I don’t care about the sharks swimming in Central Park after a thunderstorm,” Farid said. “I try to limit myself to the things that I think are impactful and have a bit of a ticking clock.”
But he admits that turnaround times are a chronic challenge facing journalists. “You’ve got a content verification problem, but you also have a speed problem and a volume problem. And arguably, the speed and the volume are really the problem,” he said.
That’s especially concerning because some of the most nefarious election-related deepfakes in the region have been documented in the 48 hours before a major voting day.
In February, an audio clip of Imran Khan, the former prime minister of Pakistan, was released the day before the country’s general election. In the clip, an AI-generated voice mimicking Khan urged voters to boycott the elections, and claimed the vote had been rigged. In that case, the clip was quickly debunked — Khan has been in prison since August of last year.

In January, a similar incident plagued neighboring Bangladesh’s national assembly vote. On election day, two AI-generated videos of independent candidates, in which they appeared to say they were withdrawing from the race and supporting their opposition, began circulating on Facebook.
The incidents beg the question of what will happen in India when a fact check is needed in a matter of hours, not a matter of days or weeks? Amid competition for the limited time of a limited pool of academics, some newsrooms have already turned to commercial detection tools to solve this problem.
Among dozens of free tools, Hive Moderation comes up frequently, since it offers a free dashboard for basic image, audio, and video detection, alongside its money-making enterprise services. AI or Not offers 10 free tests of image files per month before charging kicks in. For audio deepfakes, Eleven Labs, a well-known AI audio generation company, has created its own free detection tool called AI Speech Classifier. It can only be used to confirm whether Eleven Labs itself was used to create a recording, though, and any other audio deepfake will slip beneath its radar.
Earlier this month, OpenAI announced it’s developing a similar detection tool for images generated using Dall-E. The tool has yet to launch. Last year, OpenAI released a similar classifier for AI-generated text, but it was shut down within six months because of its low rate of accuracy.
 “I would prefer academic institutions any day of the week. There’s no question in my head at all, because the quality of the analysis will be far more robust than any commercial tool out there,” said Rebelo. In the past, Boom Live has tried to use free, publicly available AI image detectors, with mixed results. In one case Rebelo had to issue a retraction after a faulty result from an AI image testing service, an experience she calls “scarring.”
Given the limited bandwidth of academics, Boom Live invested in a subscription to Loccus, a tool that detects audio deepfakes and is already widely used in the banking sector to verify the voices of customers, among other use cases. Loccus’ profile has risen quickly, particularly after it entered a partnership with Eleven Labs last fall to build better detection tools.
“We’ve definitely seen a surge in demand this year [from journalists],” said Manel Terraza, the CEO and founder of Loccus. Most small fact-checking organizations, including those in India, have opted for the company’s monthly subscription. For larger media companies, Loccus tends to sell its API, which newsrooms use to service in-house tools that are charged for each minute of audio processed. Locus has signed one such deal with Agence France-Presse (AFP), the French wire service.

Little information about Loccus’ products is available to prospective customers — including its pricing tiers for journalists. Most subscription deepfake detection products on the market, including competitors Reality Defender and Deep Media, require personal consultations before signup. “When you’re building a solution like ours, you need to be very careful around adversarial attacks,” said Terraza, explaining that bad actors could try to use Loccus to reverse engineer deepfakes that evade detection.
Some journalists told me the cost of Loccus, and similar subscription products, can quickly become prohibitive for already bootstrapped newsrooms, or for independent journalists like Christopher. “I met with a couple of websites that promised to give me a response. They were behind paywalls, though, which, again, creates access friction for a journalist on a deadline,” he said.
One solution to these cost problems though has started to emerge among Indian journalists — pooling newsroom resources.
The Misinformation Combat Alliance (MCA) offers one model for how news organizations in India are working together to address both capacity and cost barriers in deepfake detection. Launched in 2022, the MCA currently includes 12 Indian fact-checking organizations among its ranks, including Boom Live, Logically Facts, India Today, and The Quint.
In February, the coalition launched a dedicated WhatsApp tipline called the Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU). The tipline is open to anyone, including journalists, to submit. To subsidize its operating costs, the DAU is receiving direct funding from Meta, which owns WhatsApp and has long been criticized for enabling the flow of political disinformation across India.
The most popular messaging platform in the country, WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, meaning false information can be forwarded from private group chat to private group chat without easy detection. The BJP is reported to operate as many as 5 million WhatsApp groups across the country.
The DAU has hired three full-time editorial staff in India to triage requests that come in on WhatsApp. If the team determines something could be a deepfake, they’ll conduct verification using standard AI detection tools and OSINT techniques. If there are signs of manipulation, that same clip may be passed off to one of the DAU’s forensic partners. That includes deepfake detection labs at academic institutions, like Hany Farid’s lab at UC Berkeley. It also includes the developers of for-profit authentication tools, including IdentifAI and Contrails AI, which send back detailed analysis free of charge.
Currently, the DAU is only servicing video and audio clips in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu, but not images or clips in other regional languages.

“The DAU becomes a sort of central nodal point to coordinate with a lot of different forensic partners. Otherwise, what was happening was all the fact-checkers were reaching out to set up individual partnerships with certain labs and startups. It wasn’t efficient,” said Tarunima Prabhakar, co-founder of the Delhi-based Tattle Civic Technologies, which is a member of the MCA and has been central to launching the DAU tip line.
There are other advantages to newsrooms working as a collective, according to Prabhakar, including bargaining power. “Big AI content-generation companies might not speak to a specific group in India, but as an alliance of 12 fact-checking orgs, they are speaking to us.”
RELATED ARTICLEHow I explained AI and deepfakes using only basic VietnameseLam Thuy Vo, The MarkupApril 29, 2024The same can be said for academics. “We tend to try to work with umbrella groups, like when the AP does a fact-check, hundreds of organizations get that fact check,” said Farid, the Berkeley professor, who mentioned the MCA is among the umbrella organizations he works with closely.
The DAU is also able to offer access to commercial detection tools by proxy. With proper coordination, newsrooms can avoid charges for each testing the same media item by routing their verification through the DAU or reviewing public reports on content the DAU has already tested.
The DAU may not be a silver bullet for spotting deepfakes in India’s complex information ecosystem, but it is one innovative model for cross-industry, cross-newsroom collaboration. It’s also a model that could be replicated by other newsrooms around the world as they navigate deepfake coverage during their own upcoming election cycles.
The challenge of finding deepfakes amongst the deluge of political media circulating in India right now is daunting. The tools used to detect them are new. But the dynamics on the ground are, unfortunately, more than familiar.
“I would argue the bigger story is good old-fashioned social media: Twitter and YouTube, Facebook and TikTok, Telegram and WhatsApp,” said Farid. Political deepfakes can only travel so far without being disseminated across group chats and newsfeeds and For You Pages.
“If you send a deepfake to five of your email friends, I’m not worried. It’s how these deepfakes are not just being allowed on platforms, but being promoted and algorithmically amplified and rewarded and monetized,” he added. “That’s an age-old story there. In fact, it’s not even a generative AI story.”
This story has been corrected to accurately describe the Deepfakes Analysis Unit’s internal verification process.

NEW DELHI, May 18: Bihar has been the only state in the Hindi heartland where the BJP hasn’t ever been able to secure a majority on its own but the 2024 Lok Sabha and the assembly elections next year will unveil the political landscape of the state, says a new book.
In “Broken Promises: Caste, Crime and Politics in Bihar”, Mrityunjay Sharma tells the story of Bihar’s plunge into an abyss of crime, corruption and economic ruin during the tumultuous decade of the 1990s, often referred to as the ‘jungle raj’ years.
Sharma traces the post-Independence socio-politics of Bihar and the momentous events leading up to the ‘90s – the unravelling of long-standing Congress governments, the rise of OBC assertion with Lohiaite politics, the JP movement that put the spotlight on young leaders like Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar, Karpoori Thakur’s reservation formula, the rise of Naxal movements and the entry of socialist governments.
The author says Bihar is the only state in the Hindi heartland where the BJP hasn’t ever been able to secure a majority on its own.
“While in Uttar Pradesh, which at many levels seems similar to Bihar, the BJP has been able to secure decisive mandates in successive elections. The Hindu consolidation that seems to work well in Uttar Pradesh seems to bow down to caste considerations in Bihar,” he says.
He argues that the current uncertainty surrounding Nitish’s future leaves Bihar at a crucial political crossroads.
“The 2024 general elections and 2025 state elections will unveil the political landscape of Bihar, a region that has never succumbed to political complacency,” Sharma says.
According to him, Nitish has long been twisting and tossing to find a comfortable footing in Bihar and national politics and his political challenges seemed no less than his administrative challenges.
He says Nitish strongly believed in the political dictum that you have to be in power first to be able to do anything good.
“It may be the inclination to this principle that led him to concentrate power in himself and thus avoid any dangers to his party and government,” the author claims.
In a state where every regional party associated itself with a particular caste, such as the RJD with Yadavs, the LJP with Paswans, and the JMM with adivasis, Nitish took all possible measures not to be perceived as a Kurmi-centric party, the book, published by Westland, says.
Even later, the new party entrants in Bihar politics such as the RLSP (Rashtriya Lok Samta Party), the VIP (Vikassheel Insaan Party) and the HAM (Hindustani Awam Morcha) would identify themselves with the specific castes of Kushwaha, Mallah and Musahar respectively, it says.
Sharma also writes that Nitish slowly reined in the influence of strong personalities within the party, thus reducing the scope for multiple power centres.
“Unlike its predecessors, the JD(U) never suffered a split and was hardly affected when even significant names such as its Samata Party-founding partner George Fernandes or JD(U)- founding leader Sharad Yadav were shunted out.
“Nitish became both the president of the party as well as the leader of house legislators. Ironically, in this case, he followed all other regional parties in making the JD(U) an individual-centric party. He also made sure that the individual was him,” he adds.
The author says that coalitions have rarely had such longevity as has been seen in Bihar.
“Coalitions are delicately balanced partnerships and depend on a number of factors, such as the relative strengths of parties, overlap and contrast in messaging and vote banks, the electoral advantages of going alone versus as a coalition, and personal equations between senior leaders of the coalition,” he writes.
Sharma says the period from 1990-2005 was a long and tragic one in the recent history of Bihar.
“Ironically, tragedies often make for the most compelling stories. My book is a humble attempt to give the unfamiliar reader a chance to understand what it actually meant to live through the ‘jungle raj’ years of Bihar and how it pushed Bihar forever into the realm of irredeemable ignominy,” he says.

For N Chandrababu Naidu, one of the senior-most politicians in the country, it’s the most relishing success so far. Naidu, who was ruled out by many till a few months ago, has emerged as a key party member in national politics by winning 16 seats in the elections.
In his mid-seventies, when he was reduced to just 23 out of 175 seats in the 2019 elections, everyone thought the game was over for him. It’s not to be. A politician with a never-say-die attitude, Naidu weathered several storms, including an attack by Naxalites in 2002, later defeated by Y S Rajasekhara Reddy in 2024, and a humiliating defeat in the hands of Jagan Mohan Reddy.
All set to bag 80 per cent of the seats in the 175-seat-strong Andhra Pradesh Assembly and 21 seats in Lok Sabha, the NDA alliance in Andhra Pradesh has emerged as the most formidable States for the alliance in the country.
A shrewd politician that he is, Naidu knew well that he couldn’t take on Jagan Mohan Reddy on his own. He allied with film actor Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party, which has huge support among the Kapus, a dominant caste in the State—and convinced the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to let him in the NDA. That was difficult because Naidu had angered Narendra Modi and Amit Shah just before the 2019 elections.
Cut up with his strong criticism, Modi and Amit Shah kept Naidu at arm’s length for over four years. But, it was Naidu who saw the importance of joining the NDA. He saw two advantages – surrogate support from the national law-enforcing agencies and reprieve from the election-time highhandedness at the hands of the State Government.
He had to eat his humble pie and wait for over four days in Delhi along with his Pawan Kalyan. He could finally convince the BJP and join the NDA alliance.
By winning 16 seats in the Lok Sabha, the TDP has emerged as a key player in national politics. For starters, it is not the first time for the TDP to play an important role. From 1999 to 20023, Naidu was A B Vajpayee’s Man Friday. He even influenced the then BJP’s Central leadership that time to go for early polls.
With the NDA alliance winning a slender majority at the Centre, political analysts have already started discussing what role Naidu would play in the formation of the Government. Some even hinted what would happen to the NDA alliance if Chandrababu Naidu and Niteesh Kumar, both belong to the same school of politics, switch loaylties to the INDIA bloc.

The counting today made for a nail-biting experience, with surprises and shocks all through. 
But one aspect that clearly comes out is the fact that by and large people have chosen good candidates over parties, which is quite a positive sign. 
The results have been a mixed bag, wherein some set targets have not been met, while in some cases parties have performed beyond expectations. 
In a nutshell, the people have given an intelligent and well thought-out verdict, and not one based on emotions and favouritism. 
Vijay Shekhar 
Chennai 

There are three welcome developments that have come out of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. One, we now have have a very strong Opposition that has been eluding us for a decade. 
Two, we may have a BJP government that has the chance to benefit from a coalition arrangement. 
Three, as a nation the electorate has attained a maturity that is getting scarcer in even established democracies elsewhere. 
People have authoritatively pushed to the front issues that are at the very core of their concerns. 
This will help the government in a course correction and a retuning of its policies. 
R Narayanan 
Navi Mumbai 

The election results, which were to usher in Modi 3.0, were unexpected. The exaggerated and high pitch campaigns of the political parties have crashed and shocked both NDA and I.N.D.I.A alliances. UP shocked. Even opinion and exit polls lost credibility this time. The governance will undergo a change with focus on the economy, development agenda, industry and job creation. Several minor alliance partners have dissipated. There are several surprises in the defeat of stalwarts. Two assembly election wins of NDA in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh will majorly transform NDA politics.PM Modi faces tough challenges in his third term. Subsequent elections should abandon caste and religious agenda. 
Vinod Johri 
New Delhi 

The results points to clarity in voters’ mind. The winners need not feel elated and the losers need not feel deflated as the margins of victory and defeat were so slender. 
Another message this election result gives is that people in general are not happy with the pro-rich policy that has been pursued in the last 10 years. There is a dire need to care for the middle class who cannot tighten their belts any further. Democracy survives better only in the presence of a strong opposition and absolute power given to any one party leads to authoritarian rule. 
Irrespective of the party that forms the government it is all the more important to keep in mind that enriching the rich, sharpening the communal divide and misusing the government agencies should be done away with. Focusing on employment, taming inflation and bridging the gap between the haves and the haves-not are to be prioritised, to avoid social conflict. 
AG Rajmohan 
Anantapur

On his campaign trail, Omar Abdullah - a third-generation politician and scion of the first family of Kashmir - is always in a hurry.
The 54-year-old is contesting for a seat in India's parliament from Baramulla in north Kashmir.
With over a million voters to appeal to, Mr Abdullah sets off for 10 hours of gruelling campaigning, trying to reach as many constituents as possible.
As leader of the Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC), he has added responsibility to campaign for other JKNC candidates.
Once the only Muslim-majority state in the country, Kashmir was stripped of its special status on the 5 August 2019.
Its legislative assembly dismissed and the state downgraded to a union territory bringing it directly under the control of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
The move was deeply unpopular with the people.
In an interview at his family home in the town of Gulmarg, Mr Abdullah tells Sky News the special status protections had ""basically safeguarded our identity, it safeguarded our land and our jobs, it safeguarded pretty much our existence"".
In previous elections in India, Prime Minister Modi has campaigned across the country on removing the special status (Article 370) and bringing security to the region.
However, Mr Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have decided not to contest this year's general election there.
Mr Abdullah says: ""A party (BJP) that has contested every election (in Kashmir) since 1996 unsuccessfully, has completely disappeared this time.
""If what (they have) done is so popular, why would (they) not take this opportunity to get (their) candidates in this election?
""Being a Muslim-majority area they would have to field Muslim candidates, which might have sort of affected their narrative in the rest of the country. That's one possibility.
""Or the second is that what they did in 2019 has been deeply unpopular and don't want to be proven through votes.""
Mr Abdullah's campaign is essentially about self-respect, protection of the land and preservation of Kashmiri identity.
Under the special status, property, jobs, scholarships and other privileges were protected for domicile Kashmiris.
The concerns of high unemployment, inflation and cost of living are issues people talk about, but the dominant theme is the loss of Kashmir's distinctive character.
The democratic process that suffered decades of conflict is slowly reviving.

More than 38% voted for the Srinagar seat in Jammu and Kashmir earlier this week - the highest amount in 35 years.
There is enthusiasm among people to participate in campaigns and political rallies.
Political analyst Bashir Manzar says: ""Locals are not stakeholders in decision-making or consulted whenever laws and regulations are being framed. So they feel left out, voiceless, disempowered drastically. This election has given them a chance to come out to say we matter, our voices matter, our aspirations matter.
""Also the influence of militant guns and that leadership which called boycotts and strikes has come down drastically.""

Another man, Gulam Batt, joins in and says: ""I am speaking to someone like you after many years, I feel there is some normalcy. But I am scared, maybe at night someone will come and say 'you spoke out, come to jail'.""
Waheed Para, 34, a candidate from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who contested the seat in Srinagar, knows the risks too well.
He was imprisoned for years on terror charges and says: ""I'm taking a huge risk when I'm talking to you but then somebody has to stand and take risks to represent our own people.
""We are not doing anything unconstitutional or anti-India. We want the dignity of Kashmiris to be intact.""
Kashmir is symbolic and very significant, a region over which arch-rivals India and Pakistan have fought wars.
It has been called a nuclear flash point. It is one of the most militarised zones in the region.
The elections have also heightened security concerns with more boots on the ground.
It is imperative for the government and election machinery to provide free and fair elections.
""People are feeling suffocated, there is the cycle of silence continuously being here from the last five to six years. This election in a way is an act of healing people,"" Mr Para says.

NEW DELHI, June 4: Preparing to take office for a record third consecutive term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday pledged to work with all states, regardless of the party in power, to build a developed India.
In his first speech after the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Modi laid out his vision for the third term saying it would be a tenure of big decisions and key emphasis would be on uprooting corruption.
“The fight against corruption is becoming tougher by the day. Corruption is being shamelessly glorified for political interest. In our third term, NDA will focus a lot on rooting out corruption of all kinds,” Modi said.
Modi’s speech did not refer to its reduced numbers in Parliament but focussed on the “clean sweep” victories in assembly elections as well as Lok Sabha wins in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
Modi also said that the Congress has been wiped out in several states and pointed out that the combined number of seats won by the opposition alliance was less than that of the BJP alone.
Modi’s victory speech at the BJP headquarters, however, was thin on politics and heavy on the future roadmap of his government, which he noted was coming for the third consecutive time, a first in six decades.
“Our Constitution is our guiding light. I want to assure that the Centre will work with all states, irrespective of the party in power there, to work towards our resolve to make India a developed country,” Modi said.
The prime minister arrived at the BJP headquarters to a rousing welcome by hundreds of supporters who chanted ‘Modi, Modi’. He was greeted by BJP President J P Nadda and Union Ministers Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah on the dais.
The backdrop on the stage had ‘Dhanyawad Bharat’ written in various languages, including Urdu.
Modi began his speech with ‘Jai Jagannath’ and thanked the people of Odisha for giving BJP a clear mandate for the first time.
He also thanked TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar — his NDA allies – for the electoral successes in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar. (PTI)

NEW DELHI, June 4: Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which is set to oust the incumbent YSRC in Andhra Pradesh’s state elections, on Tuesday vowed to reinstate Amaravati as the capital city, a plan that was shelved by the outgoing state government.
As of 8.30 pm, the Election Commission data showed TDP winning 102 seats and leading in 32 more in the 175-member assembly, indicating a landslide victory.
“Amaravati is the capital of Andhra Pradesh, there is no second thought about it. It will be developed,” TDP’s senior leader Kanakamedala Ravindrakumar told PTI.
The capital’s location has been a point of contention since Andhra Pradesh’s bifurcation in 2014. Hyderabad was made the common capital for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh until June 2, 2024, under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act.
YSRC chief and outgoing Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy’s plan to establish three state capitals, moving away from Amaravati, faced legal challenges.
Ravindrakumar accused the YSRC government of stalling Amaravati’s construction and other projects initiated by TDP’s N Chandrababu Naidu.
He also alleged human rights violations by the YSRC.The election results suggest a strong endorsement of TDP’s development agenda. (PTI)

There are two ways of trying to understand the June 2024 general election results: figuring out the meaning of the verdict, or the reasons for the BJP’s underwhelming performance; and its consequences for the new government. In the absence of sufficient information, it is hard to pinpoint the broader forces that have dragged the BJP below the majority mark.
But some surmises can be made: a sense of hubris; a feeling that a huge majority for the BJP could lead to the Constitution being fundamentally changed, taking away quotas for the dalits and OBCs; dissatisfaction over inflation and unemployment; a reaction to the promotion of personality cult using State resources; the perception regarding use of State power to browbeat political opponents; an attempt to steamroller regional parties; and maybe, an overdose of religious messaging and innuendo. 
It will take some time to figure out which forces were at work, and in what measure. 
But the results per se tell us a few things. First, the BJP’s loss has been the Congress’ gain. Congress had fared poorly in a straight contest against the BJP in the last two general elections. Therefore, the performance of the Congress this time should bolster its confidence in upcoming Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana. 

Second, the regional parties have held their own against the BJP juggernaut, with the exception of the Biju Janata Dal, whose loss in both the general and Assembly polls seems to be a straightforward case of anti-incumbency. 
The election, characterised by the good show by DMK, Telugu Desam, NCP-Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray), Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party, marks a pushback against a homogenising force. Many of these parties came into being in the 1980s and 1990s to counter the centralising, anti-democratic tendencies of the Congress party at that time. Now, the wheel has come full circle, with the BJP being perceived in a somewhat similar way to the Congress of yesteryear — as a threat to regional forces. 
In contrast to the BJP under Atal Behari Vajpayee, there are more regional parties against the BJP today than those with it. It is worth asking whether the BJP central leadership has paid a price for being too pushy and meddlesome with its erstwhile alliance partners. 
This regionalist pushback marks a federal assertion against central policies, which should make the BJP strategists wonder whether its slogan of ‘double-engine ki sarkar’ in Assembly elections has been well received. To many, it would seem like the Centre trying to be the boss. 
This pushback seems pronounced in Maharashtra, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The BJP brought the Maharashtra debacle upon itself by doing an ‘Operation Kamal’ there — bringing down the Maha Vikas Agadi government and triggering a split in the Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena. Its alliance partners in Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar became liabilities for the BJP, whereas Uddhav Thackeray benefited politically from his clumsy ouster. 
The reasons for TMC surpassing its 2019 performance could be State-specific. Tamil Nadu’s result could be influenced by familiar socio-cultural undercurrents. 
The BJP has also benefited in certain States due to local factors. It has reaped the benefits of anti-incumbency in Odisha. Its ally, Telugu Desam, has done the same in Andhra Pradesh. It should be a cause of some satisfaction to the BJP, and perhaps even the Congress, that Aam Aadmi Party, has not fared well in Delhi and Punjab. 
The Congress might have nearly doubled its tally, but its performance in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and to an extent Telangana, where it is in power, should be a cause for concern — just as it can derive some satisfaction from its results in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. 
The mood shift in India’s biggest State, Uttar Pradesh, will be a subject of discussion for sometime. 
The BJP will have some introspection to do on what went wrong. A quiet churn within the party cannot be ruled out. 
A coalition government is a certainty. This is likely to balance Centre-State power. Its effects on policymaking are likely to be positive. 
Decisions will be marked by more deliberation and negotiation. India’s post-1990 experience with coalition governments has been quite positive. The virtues of ‘absolute majority’ are certainly overblown, as coalitions bring with them their own checks and balances, so essential in a democracy. 
A return to sober governance, sans over-the-top ideological messaging and hyper-narratives, is perhaps what the people really want and need.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.
No one knows why the Hohokam Indians vanished. They had carved hundreds of miles of canals in the Sonoran Desert with stone tools and channeled the waters of the Salt and Gila Rivers to irrigate their crops for a thousand years until, in the middle of the 15th century, because of social conflict or climate change—drought, floods—their technology became obsolete, their civilization collapsed, and the Hohokam scattered. Four hundred years later, when white settlers reached the territory of southern Arizona, they found the ruins of abandoned canals, cleared them out with shovels, and built crude weirs of trees and rocks across the Salt River to push water back into the desert. Aware of a lost civilization in the Valley, they named the new settlement Phoenix.

It grew around water. In 1911, Theodore Roosevelt stood on the steps of the Tempe Normal School, which, half a century later, would become Arizona State University, and declared that the soaring dam just completed in the Superstition Mountains upstream, established during his presidency and named after him, would provide enough water to allow 100,000 people to live in the Valley. There are now 5 million.
The Valley is one of the fastest-growing regions in America, where a developer decided to put a city of the future on a piece of virgin desert miles from anything. At night, from the air, the Phoenix metroplex looks like a glittering alien craft that has landed where the Earth is flat and wide enough to host it. The street grids and subdivisions spreading across retired farmland end only when they’re stopped by the borders of a tribal reservation or the dark folds of mountains, some of them surrounded on all sides by sprawl.
Phoenix makes you keenly aware of human artifice—its ingenuity and its fragility. The American lust for new things and new ideas, good and bad ones, is most palpable here in the West, but the dynamo that generates all the microchip factories and battery plants and downtown high-rises and master-planned suburbs runs so high that it suggests its own oblivion. New Yorkers and Chicagoans don’t wonder how long their cities will go on existing, but in Phoenix in August, when the heat has broken 110 degrees for a month straight, the desert golf courses and urban freeways give this civilization an air of impermanence, like a mirage composed of sheer hubris, and a surprising number of inhabitants begin to brood on its disappearance.
Growth keeps coming at a furious pace, despite decades of drought, and despite political extremism that makes every election a crisis threatening violence. Democracy is also a fragile artifice. It depends less on tradition and law than on the shifting contents of individual skulls—belief, virtue, restraint. Its durability under natural and human stress is being put to an intense test in the Valley. And because a vision of vanishing now haunts the whole country, Phoenix is a guide to our future.
Among the white settlers who rebuilt the Hohokam canals were the Mormon ancestors of Rusty Bowers. In the 1890s, they settled in the town of Mesa, east of Phoenix and a few miles downstream from where the Verde River joins the Salt. In 1929, when Bowers’s mother was a little girl, she was taken to hear the Church president, believed to be a prophet. For the rest of her life, she would recall one thing he told the assembly: “I foresee the day when there will be lines of people leaving this valley because there is no water.”
The Valley’s several thousand square miles stretch from Mesa in the east to Buckeye in the west. Bowers lives on a hill at Mesa’s edge, about as far east as you can go before the Valley ends, in a pueblo-style house where he and his wife raised seven children. He is lean, with pale-blue eyes and a bald sunspotted head whose pinkish creases and scars in the copper light of a desert sunset give him the look of a figure carved from the sandstone around him. So his voice comes as a surprise—playful cadences edged with a husky sadness. He trained to be a painter, but instead he became one of the most powerful men in Arizona, a 17-year state legislator who rose to speaker of the House in 2019. The East Valley is conservative and so is Bowers, though he calls himself a “pinto”—a spotted horse—meaning capable of variations. When far-right House members demanded a 30 percent across-the-board budget cut, he made a deal with Democrats to cut far less, and found the experience one of the most liberating of his life. He believes that environmentalists worship Creation instead of its Creator, but he drives a Prius as well as a pickup.
In the late 2010s, the Arizona Republican Party began to worry Bowers with its growing radicalism: State meetings became vicious free-for-alls; extremists unseated mainstream conservatives. Still, he remained a member in good standing—appearing at events with Donald Trump during the president’s reelection campaign, handing out Trump flyers door-to-door—until the morning of Sunday, November 22, 2020.
Bowers and his wife had just arrived home from church when the Prius’s Bluetooth screen flashed WHITE HOUSE. Rudy Giuliani was calling, and soon afterward the freshly defeated president came on the line. As Bowers later recalled, there was the usual verbal backslapping, Trump telling him what a great guy he was and Bowers thanking Trump for helping with his own reelection. Then Giuliani got to the point. The election in Arizona had been riddled with fraud: piles of military ballots stolen and illegally cast, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens and dead people voting, gross irregularities at the counting centers. Bowers had been fielding these stories from Republican colleagues and constituents and found nothing credible in them.
“Do you have proof of that?” Bowers asked.
“Yeah,” Giuliani replied.
“Do you have names?”
“Oh yeah.”
“I need proof, names, how they voted, and I need it on my desk.”
“Rudy,” Trump broke in, “give the man what he wants.”
Bowers sensed some further purpose to the call. “To what end? What’s the ask here?”
“Rudy, what’s the ask?” Trump echoed, as if he didn’t know.
America’s ex-mayor needed Bowers to convene a committee to investigate the evidence of fraud. Then, according to an “arcane” state law that had been brought to Giuliani’s attention by someone high up in Arizona Republican circles, the legislature could replace the state’s Biden electors with a pro-Trump slate.
The car was idling on the dirt driveway by a four-armed saguaro cactus. “That’s a new one,” Bowers said. “I’ve never heard that one before. You need to tell me more about that.”
Giuliani admitted that he personally wasn’t an expert on Arizona law, but he’d been told about a legal theory, which turned out to have come from a paper written by a 63-year-old state representative and avid Trump partisan named Mark Finchem, who was studying for a late-in-life master’s degree at the University of Arizona.
“We’re asking you to consider this,” Trump told Bowers.
“Mr. President …”
Bowers prayed a lot, about things large and small. But prayer doesn’t deliver instant answers. So that left conscience, which everyone is blessed with but some do their best to kill. An immense number of Trump-era Republican officeholders had killed theirs in moments like this one. Bowers, who considered the Constitution divinely inspired, felt his conscience rising up into his throat: Don’t do it. You’ve got to tell him you won’t do it.
“I swore an oath to the Constitution,” Bowers said.
“Well, you know,” Giuliani said, “we’re all Republicans, and we need to be working together.”
“Mr. President,” Bowers said, “I campaigned for you. I voted for you. The policies you put in did a lot of good. But I will do nothing illegal for you.”
“We’re asking you to consider this,” Trump again told Bowers.
At the end of November, Trump’s legal team flew to Phoenix and met with Republican legislators. Bowers asked Giuliani for proof of voter fraud. “We don’t have the evidence,” Giuliani said, “but we have a lot of theories.” The evidence never materialized, so the state party pushed the theories, colleagues in the legislature attacked Bowers on Twitter, and a crowd swarmed the capitol in December to denounce him. One of the most vocal protesters was a young Phoenix man a month away from world fame as the QAnon Shaman.
On December 4, Bowers wrote in his diary:
Caravans of trucks climbed the road to Bowers’s house with pro-Trump flags and video panels and loudspeakers blasting to his neighbors that he was corrupt, a traitor, a pervert, a pedophile. His daughter Kacey, who had struggled with alcoholism, was now dying, and the mob outside the house upset her. At one point, Bowers went out to face them and encountered a man in a Three Percenter T-shirt, with a semiautomatic pistol on his hip, screaming abuse. Bowers walked up close enough to grab the gun if the Three Percenter drew. “I see you brought your little pop gun,” he said. “You gonna shoot me? Yell all you want—don’t touch that gun.” He knew that it would take only one would-be patriot under the influence of hateful rhetoric to kill him. He would later tell the January 6 congressional committee: “The country is at a very delicate part where this veneer of civilization is thinner than my fingers pressed together.”
Emails poured in. On December 7, someone calling themselves hunnygun wrote:
Three days before Christmas, Bowers was sitting on his patio when Trump called again—this time without his attorney, and with a strange message that might have been an attempt at self-exculpation. “I remember what you told me the last time we spoke,” Trump said. Bowers took this as a reference to his refusal to do anything illegal, which he repeated. “I get it,” Trump said. “I don’t want you to.” He thanked Bowers for his support during the campaign. “I hope your family has a merry Christmas.”
Kacey Bowers died at age 42 on January 28, 2021. COVID rules kept the family from her hospital bedside until her final hours. Bowers, a lay priest in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, gave his daughter a blessing, and at the very end, the family sang a hymn by John Henry Newman:
The gloom thickened. Bowers’s enemies launched an effort to recall him, with foot soldiers provided by the Trump youth organization Turning Point USA, which is headquartered in Phoenix. The recall failed, but it was an ill omen. That summer, a wildfire in the mountains destroyed the Bowers ranch, taking his library, his papers, and many of his paintings. In 2022, after Bowers testified before the January 6 committee in Washington, D.C., the state party censured him and another stream of abuse came to his doorstep. Term-limited in the House, he ran for a Senate seat just to let the party know that it couldn’t bully him out. He was demolished by a conspiracist with Trump’s backing. Bowers’s political career was over.
“What do you do?” Bowers said. “You stand up. That’s all you can do. You have to get back up. When we lost the place and saw the house was still burning and now there’s nothing there, gone, and to have 23-plus years of a fun place with the family to be gone—it’s hard. Is it the hardest? No. Not even close. I keep on my phone (I won’t play it for you) my last phone call from my daughter—how scared she was, a port came out of her neck, they were transporting her, she was bleeding all over, and she says: ‘Dad, please, help me, please!’ Compared to a phone call from the president, compared to your house burning down? So what? What do you do, Dad? Those are hard things. But they come at us all. They’re coming at us as a country … What do we do? You get up.”
Bowers went back to painting. He took a job with a Canadian water company called EPCOR. Water had obsessed him all his life—he did not want the prophet’s vision to come to pass on his watch. One bright day last October, we stood on the Granite Reef Diversion Dam a few miles from his house, where the two main water systems that nourish the Valley meet at the foot of Red Mountain, sacred to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indians, whose reservation stood just across the dry bed of the river. Below the dam’s headgate three-foot carp thrashed in the turbulent water of the South Canal, and wild horses waded in the shallows upstream.
“What’s the politics of water here?” I asked.
Bowers laughed, incredulous. “Oh my gosh, that question. It’s everywhere. You’ve heard the dictum.”
I had heard the dictum from everyone in the Valley who thought about the subject. “Whiskey’s for drinking—”
“Water’s for fighting,” Bowers finished, and then he amended it: “Water’s for killing.”
Summer in the Valley for most of its inhabitants is like winter in Minnesota—or winter in Minnesota 20 years ago. People stay inside as much as possible and move only if absolutely necessary among the artificial sanctuaries of home, car, and work. Young professionals in the arts district emerge after dark to walk their dogs. When the sun is high, all human presence practically disappears from the streets, and you notice how few trees there are in Phoenix.
Frank Lloyd Wright disliked air-conditioning. During a visit to Taliesin West, the home and studio he built from desert stone in the 1930s on a hillside north of Phoenix, I read in his book The Natural House :
The observation gets at the unnaturalness of the Valley, because its civilization is unthinkable without air-conditioning. But the massive amount of energy required to keep millions of people alive in traffic jams is simultaneously burning them up, because air-conditioning accounts for 4 percent of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions, twice that of all aviation.
One morning last August, goaded by Wright and tired of air-conditioned driving, I decided to walk the mile from my hotel to an interview at the Maricopa County Recorder’s Office. Construction workers were sweating and hydrating on the site of a new high-rise. A few thin figures slouched on benches by the Valley Metro tracks. At a bus shelter, a woman lay on the sidewalk in some profound oblivion. After four blocks my skin was prickling and I thought about turning back for my rental car, but I couldn’t face suffocating at the wheel while I waited for the air to cool. By the time I reached the Recorder’s Office, I was having trouble thinking, as if I’d moved significantly closer to the sun.
Last summer—when the temperature reached at least 110 degrees on 55 days (above 110, people said, it all feels the same), and the midsummer monsoon rains never came, and Phoenix found itself an object of global horror—heat officially helped kill 644 people in Maricopa County. They were the elderly, the sick, the mentally ill, the isolated, the homeless, the addicted (methamphetamines cause dehydration and fentanyl impairs thought), and those too poor to own or fix or pay for air-conditioning, without which a dwelling can become unlivable within an hour. Even touching the pavement is dangerous. A woman named Annette Vasquez, waiting in line outside the NourishPHX food pantry, lifted her pant leg to show me a large patch of pink skin on her calf—the scar of a second-degree burn from a fall she’d taken during a heart attack in high heat after seven years on the streets.
Read: The problem with ‘Why do people live in Phoenix?’
It was 115 on the day I met Dr. Aneesh Narang at the emergency department of Banner–University Medical Center. He had already lost four or five patients to heatstroke over the summer and just treated one who was brought in with a body temperature of 106 degrees, struggling to breathe and unable to sweat. “Patients coming in at 108, 109 degrees—they’ve been in the heat for hours, they’re pretty much dead,” Narang said. “We try to cool them down as fast as we can.” The method is to strip off their clothes and immerse them in ice and tap water inside a disposable cadaver bag to get their temperature down to 100 degrees within 15 or 20 minutes. But even those who survive heatstroke risk organ failure and years of neurological problems.
Recently, a hyperthermic man had arrived at Narang’s emergency department lucid enough to speak. He had become homeless not long before and was having a hard time surviving in the heat—shelters weren’t open during the day, and he didn’t know how to find the city’s designated cooling centers. “I can’t keep up with this,” he told the doctor. “I can’t get enough water. I’m tired.”
Saving a homeless patient only to send him back out into the heat did not feel like a victory to Narang. “It’s a Band-Aid on a leaking dam,” he said. “We haven’t solved a deep-rooted issue here. We’re sending them back to an environment that got them here—that’s the sad part. The only change that helps that situation is ending homelessness. It’s a problem in a city that’ll get hotter and hotter every year. I’m not sure what it’ll look like in 2050.”
The mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego, has a degree in environmental science and has worked on water policy in the region. “We are trying to very much focus on becoming a more sustainable community,” she told me in her office at city hall. Her efforts include the appointment of one of the country’s first heat czars; zoning and tax policies to encourage housing built up rather than out (downtown Phoenix is a forest of cranes); a multibillion-dollar investment in wastewater recycling; solar-powered shipping containers used as cooling centers and temporary housing on city lots; and a shade campaign of trees, canopies, and public art on heavily walked streets.
But the homeless population of metro Phoenix has nearly doubled in the past six years amid a housing shortage, soaring rents, and NIMBYism; multifamily affordable housing remain dirty words in most Valley neighborhoods. Nor is there much a mayor can do about the rising heat. A scientific study published in May 2023 projected that a blackout during a five-day heat wave would kill nearly 1 percent of Phoenix’s population—about 13,000 people—and send 800,000 to emergency rooms.
Near the airport, on the treeless streets south of Jefferson and north of Grant, there was a no-man’s-land around the lonely tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad, with scrap metal and lumber yards, stacks of pallets, a food pantry, abandoned wheelchairs, tombstones scattered across a dirt cemetery, and the tents and tarps and belongings and trash of the homeless. I began to think of this area, in the dead center of the Valley, as the heat zone. It felt hotter than anywhere else, not just because of the pavement and lack of shade, but because this was where people who couldn’t escape the furnace came. Most were Latino or Black, many were past middle age, and they came to be near a gated 13-acre compound that offered meals, medical and dental care, information about housing, a postal address, and 900 beds for single adults.
Last summer, the homeless encampment outside the compound stretched for several desolate blocks—the kind of improvised shantytown I’ve seen in Manila and Lagos but not in the United States, and not when the temperature was 111 degrees. One day in August, with every bed inside the compound taken, 563 people in varying states of consciousness were living outside. I couldn’t understand what kept them from dying.
Read: When will the Southwest become unlivable?
Mary Gilbert Todd, in her early 60s, from Charleston, South Carolina, had a cot inside Respiro, a large pavilion where men slept on one side, women on the other. Before that she’d spent four years on the streets of Phoenix. Her face was sunburned, her upper teeth were missing, and she used a walker, but her eyes gleamed bright blue with energy.
“If you put a wet shirt on and wet your hair, it’s gonna be cool,” she told me cheerfully, poking with a fork at a cup of ramen. “In the daytime, you don’t wanna walk. It’s better, when you’re homeless, to find a nice, shady tree and build yourself a black tent that you can sleep in where there’s some breeze. The black, it may absorb more heat on the outside, but it’s going to provide more shade. Here you got the dry heat. You want to have an opening so wind can go through—something that the police aren’t going to notice too much. Because if you’re in a regular tent, they’re gonna come bust you, and if you’re sitting out in the open, they’re gonna come mess with you.” She said that she’d been busted for “urban camping” 600 times.
My guide around the compound was Amy Schwabenlender, who directs it with the wry, low-key indignation of a woman working every day in the trenches of a crisis that the country appears readier to complain about than solve. “It’s America—we don’t have to have homelessness,” she said. “We allow homelessness to happen. We—the big we.” The neighbors—a casket maker, an electric-parts supplier, the owners of a few decaying houses—blamed Schwabenlender for bringing the problem to their streets, as if she were the root cause of homelessness. In the face of a lawsuit, the city was clearing the encampment.
Schwabenlender had come to the Valley to get away from depressing Wisconsin winters. After her first night in a motel in Tempe, she went out to her car and found the window heat-glued to the door by its rubber seal. “What did I just do to myself?” she wondered. Now she lives in North Phoenix in a house with a yard and a pool, but she has seen enough misery to be a growth dissident.
“I don’t know why people want to live here,” she said, smiling faintly, her pallor set off by thick black hair. “We can’t have enough housing infrastructure for everyone who wants to live here. So why are we celebrating and encouraging more business? Why are we giving large corporations tax breaks to move here? How can we encourage people to come here when we don’t have enough housing for the people who are here, and we don’t have enough water? It doesn’t add up to me.”
While we were talking, a woman with a gray crew cut who was missing her left leg below the thigh rolled up to Schwabenlender in a wheelchair. She had just been released after a long prison term and had heard something that made her think she’d get a housing voucher by the end of the month.
Schwabenlender gave an experienced sigh. “There’s a waitlist of 4,000,” she told the woman.
On my way out of Respiro, I chatted with a staff member named Tanish Bates. I mentioned the woman I’d seen lying on the sidewalk by the bus shelter in the heat of the day—she had seemed beyond anyone’s reach. “Why didn’t you talk to her?” Bates asked. “For me, it’s a natural instinct—I’m going to try. You ask them, ‘What’s going on? What do you need? Do you need water? Should I call the fire department?’ Nothing beats failure but a try.” She gave me an encouraging pat. “Next time, ask yourself what you would want.”
Utterly shamed, I walked out into the heat zone. By the compound’s gate, a security guard stood gazing at the sky. A few lonely raindrops had begun to fall. “I been praying for rain,” she said. “I am so tired of looking at the sun.” People were lining up to spend an hour or two in a city cooling bus parked at the curb. Farther down Madison Street, the tents ended and street signs announced: THIS AREA IS CLOSED TO CAMPING TO ABATE A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
Every time I returned to Phoenix, I found fewer tents around the compound. The city was clearing the encampment block by block. In December, only a few stragglers remained outside the gate—the hardest cases, fading out on fentanyl or alert enough to get into fights. “They keep coming back,” said a skinny, shirtless young man named Brandon Bisson. “They’re like wild animals. They’ll keep coming back to where the food and resources are.” Homeless for a year, he was watering a pair of healthy red bougainvillea vines in front of a rotting house where he’d been given a room with his dog in exchange for labor. Bisson wanted a job working with animals.
“There’s no news story anymore,” Schwabenlender said as she greeted me in her office. The city had opened a campground where 15th Avenue met the railroad tracks, with shipping containers and tents behind screened fencing, and 41 people were now staying there. Others had been placed in hotels. But it was hard to keep tabs on where they ended up, and some people were still out on the street, in parks, in cars, under highway overpasses. “How do we keep the sense of urgency?” Schwabenlender murmured in her quizzical way, almost as if she were speaking to herself. “We didn’t end homelessness.” The housing waitlist for Maricopa County stood at 7,503. The heat was over for now.
Civilization in the Valley depends on solving the problem of water, but because this has to be done collectively, solving the problem of water depends on solving the problem of democracy. My visits left me with reasons to believe that human ingenuity is equal to the first task: dams, canals, wastewater recycling, underground storage, desalination, artificial intelligence. But I found at least as many reasons to doubt that we are equal to the second.
It’s easy to believe that the Valley could double its population when you’re flying in a helicopter over the dams of the Salt River Project, the public utility whose lakes hold more than 2 million acre-feet—650 trillion gallons—of water; and when Mayor Gallego is describing Phoenix’s multibillion-dollar plan to recycle huge quantities of wastewater; and when Stephen Roe Lewis, the leader of the Gila River Indian Community, is walking through a recharged wetland that not long ago had been barren desert, pointing out the indigenous willows and cattails whose fibers are woven into traditional bracelets like the one around his wrist.
But when you see that nothing is left of the mighty Colorado River as it approaches the Mexican border but dirt and scrub; and when you drive by a road sign south of the Valley that says EARTH FISSURES POSSIBLE because the water table is dropping four feet a year; and when sprinklers are watering someone’s lawn in Scottsdale in the rain—then the prophet’s vision feels a little closer.
American sprawl across the land of the disappeared Hohokam looks flimsy and flat and monotonous amid the desert’s sublime Cretaceous humps. But sprawl is also the sight of ordinary people reaching for freedom in 2,000 square feet on a quarter acre. Growth is an orthodox faith in the Valley, as if the only alternative is slow death.
Once, I was driving through the desert of far-northern Phoenix with Dave Roberts, the retired head of water policy for the Salt River Project. The highway passed a concrete fortress rising in the distance, a giant construction site with a dozen cranes grasping the sky. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s three plants would employ 6,000 people; they would also consume billions of gallons of Phoenix’s water every year. Roberts filled in the empty space around the site: “All this desert land will be apartments, homes, golf courses, and who knows what—Costcos. There’s going to be malls out here. Gobs of people.” As long as people in places like Louisiana and Mississippi wanted to seek a better life in the Valley, who was he to tell them to stay away? A better life was the whole point of growth.
I asked Roberts, an intensely practical man, if he ever experienced apocalyptic visions of a dried-up Valley vanishing.
“We have three things that the Hohokam didn’t,” he said—pumping, storage (behind dams and underground), and recycling. When I mentioned this to Rusty Bowers, I couldn’t remember the third thing, and he interjected: “Prayer.” I offered that the Hohokam had probably been praying for water too. “I bet they were,” Bowers said. “And the Lord says, ‘Okay. I could go Bing! But that’s not how I work. Go out there and work, and we’ll figure this thing out together.’ ”
This famously libertarian place has a history of collective action on water. Thanks to the bipartisan efforts of the 20th century—the federal dams built in the early 1900s; the 330-mile canal that brought Colorado River water to the Valley in the late 20th century; a 1980 law regulating development in Arizona’s metro regions so they’d conserve groundwater, which cannot be replaced—Phoenix has a lot of water. But two things have happened in this century: a once-in-a-millennium drought set in, and the political will to act collectively dried up. “The legislature has become more and more partisan,” Kathleen Ferris, an architect of the 1980 law, told me. “And there’s a whole lot of denial.”
At some point, the civilization here stopped figuring this thing out together. The 1980 groundwater law, which required builders in regulated metro areas like the Valley to ensure a 100-year supply, left groundwater unregulated in small developments and across rural Arizona. In the mid-1990s, the legislature cut loopholes into the 100-year requirement. The God-given right to pursue happiness and wealth pushed housing farther out into the desert, beyond the reach of the Valley’s municipal water systems, onto groundwater. In the unregulated rural hinterland, megafarms of out-of-state and foreign agribusinesses began to pump enormous quantities of groundwater. The water table around the state was sinking, and the Colorado River was drying up.
Ferris imagined a grim future. Without new regulation, she said, “we will have land subsidence, roads cracking, destroying infrastructure, and in some cases people’s taps going dry.” The crisis wouldn’t hit the water-rich Phoenix metroplex first. “It’s going to be on the fringes, and all the people who allowed themselves to grow there are going to be really unhappy when they find out there’s no water.”
Most people in the Valley come from somewhere else, and John Hornewer came from Chicago. One summer in the early 1990s, when he was about 25, he went for a hike in the Hellsgate Wilderness, 75 miles northeast of Phoenix, and got lost. He ran out of water and couldn’t find a stream. When he grew too weak to carry his backpack, he abandoned it. His eyes began to throb; every muscle hurt; even breathing hurt. He sank to his knees, his face hit the ground, and as the flies buzzed around he thought: Just stop my heart. He was saved by campers, who found him and drove him the 20 miles he’d wandered from his car.
Almost dying from dehydration changed Hornewer’s life. “I take water very seriously,” he told me. “I’m passionate about water.”
In the late ’90s, Hornewer and his wife bought two and a half acres several miles up a dirt road in Rio Verde Foothills, a small community on the northeastern edge of the Valley. To the southwest, the city of Scottsdale ends and unincorporated Maricopa County starts where the golf courses give way to mesquite and the paved roads turn to dirt. Over the years, the desert around the Hornewers was filled in by people who wanted space and quiet and couldn’t afford Scottsdale.
Seeing a need, Hornewer started a business hauling potable water, filling his 6,000-gallon trucks with metered water at a Scottsdale standpipe and selling it to people in Rio Verde with dry wells or none at all. What kept Rio Verde cheaper than Scottsdale was the lack of an assured water supply. Wildcat builders, exploiting a gap in the 1980 law, didn’t tell buyers there wasn’t one, or the buyers didn’t ask. Meanwhile, the water table under Rio Verde was dropping. One of Hornewer’s neighbors hit water at 450 feet; another neighbor 150 feet away spent $60,000 on a 1,000-foot well that came up dry.
Hornewer wears his gray hair shoulder-length and has the face of a man trying to keep his inherent good nature from reaching its limit. In the past few years, he began to warn his Rio Verde customers that Scottsdale’s water would not always be there for them, because it came to Scottsdale by canal from the diminishing Colorado River. “We got rain a couple of weeks ago—everything’s good!” his customers w",,,

He further said, “Since the commencement of the elections, the INDIA alliance has no dissonance over the post of Prime Minister.

For the first time, ​​Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to depend on two past-masters of coalition politics ​​– TDP Chief N Chandrababu Naidu and JD(U) chief and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar – to form the government. 
The Prime Minister is believed to have spoken to Naidu and is expected to join his swearing-in as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. A meeting of the BJP-led NDA is believed to have been scheduled for Wednesday for which both Nitish Kumar and Naidu have been invited.
​​Businessline exclusive election results coverage​​
The ​gap between the NDA and the INDIA alliance is so small​, just about 60 seats, that they can make a difference to which formation forms the next government. The Congress party has said that it will discuss the possibilities on Wednesday with its partners. So, as of today, the matter of who forms the next government is still open and it’s up to the President as to who she invites to form it.
The ​State that scripted the BJP’s uninterrupted reign at the Centre for two terms brought the saffron party below the majority mark ​on Tuesday. A number of factors combined to thwart the BJP’s carefully-crafted strategy in Uttar Pradesh and the prime among them was the reverse social engineering attempted by saffron party’s main challenger – Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.
The ​TDP, which joined very late to the NDA alliance, emerged as a major player​, giving the alliance a much-needed booster shot. With the BJP falling short of the magic figure, the TDP’s support turns crucial for the alliance to form the Government at the Centre. From just three in the 2019 elections, the alliance increased its tally to 21, pushing the YSRCP to just 4 (which won 22 in 2019).
The ​Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) target of achieving a hat-trick of clean sweeps in Gujarat came undone Tuesday​, after it conceded the Banaskantha Lok Sabha seat to its rival Congress.
For the first time since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, the BJP has lost a Lok Sabha seat in Gujarat, winning 25 of the 26 seats in the State. The saffron party had won all the 26 seats during the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections and had targeted to win all the 26 seats with a victory margin of 5 lakh votes.
The ​BJP’s backed splits in Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar’s NCP​, including the controversial seizure of their party names and election symbols, backfired spectacularly. Voter anger against turncoats, coupled with issues such as agrarian distress, inflation, and the lacklustre performance of sitting BJP alliance MPs, proved to be decisive factors in the BJP’s downfall in Maharashtra.
​In a major setback to the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal​, the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress is set to increase its seats in the state to 29 in the fiercely-contested LoK Sabha elections.
Despite the prediction of most of the exit polls that the BJP would get more seats than the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state, the saffron party has bagged a lesser number of seats in the 2024 LS elections than 2019 elections. 
With the BJP falling behind the majority mark and its poll pitch of ‘400 ke par’, opposition ​INDIA bloc said on Tuesday that the 2024 Lok Sabha election mandate is against Prime Minister Narendra Modi ​and he should own up the political and moral responsibility and step aside from another stint in power.
Unlike the previous two general elections, ​a clear mandate has eluded the BJP this time and the party appears set to win 240 seats​, down 63 from the 303 it had won in 2019, and 33 short of a clear majority of 272 in the 543-member Lok Sabha.
The BJP will make up for the shortfall with Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), which looked set to win 12 seats in Bihar, and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), looking to bag 17 seats in Andhra Pradesh besides minor allies including the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, the Lok Janshakti Party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha, and the Jana Sena Party. Together, the NDA constituents come up to about 291 seats, 19 over the majority mark in the Lower House.

NEW DELHI, June 4: Regional satraps are back to holding all the aces in this Lok Sabha elections as counting trends emerged on Tuesday, with Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP and Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party making stupendous gains in Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh respectively.
While the TDP and Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) hold the key to the government formation of the NDA after the BJP fell short of getting a majority on its own, some other regional parties like the YSRCP, BRS, BJD and BSP have lost ground at the hustings.
The 2024 Lok Sabha election result trends have shown the strengthening of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, emerging as a strong force by being ahead in 34 seats while the BJP was leading in 36 seats.
In 2019, the SP had won only five seats while the Bahujan Samaj Party, which is facing a rout this time, had bagged 10 seats.
Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress has also strengthened its position from 22 Lok Sabha last time and was ahead in 29 seats out of 42 in West Bengal this time.
K Chandrashekar Rao’s BRS was not leading in any seats in the counting so far in Telangana, even though it had won nine seats last time.
Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray) in Maharashtra was also leading in nine seats, against 18 last time before the split in the party. The NCP (Sharad Pawar) was also ahead in seven seats this time against five seats in 2019.
M K Stalin-led DMK held on to its dominance in Tamil Nadu and was ahead on 21 seats this time against 23 seats in 2019.
The TDP was ahead in 16 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh and in 135 assembly seats after it decimated the ruling YSRCP led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. YSRCP had won 23 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 and came to power in the state in 2019.
In Bihar, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) was ahead on all the five seats it contested this time.
The RJD of Lalu Prasad Yadav was also gaining four seats after it did not open its account the last time.
The JMM, whose leader Hemant Soren was arrested on corruption charges, was also ahead on three seats this time. The JMM got only one seat in the 2019 election. (PTI)

The counting today made for a nail-biting experience, with surprises and shocks all through. 
But one aspect that clearly comes out is the fact that by and large people have chosen good candidates over parties, which is quite a positive sign. 
The results have been a mixed bag, wherein some set targets have not been met, while in some cases parties have performed beyond expectations. 
In a nutshell, the people have given an intelligent and well thought-out verdict, and not one based on emotions and favouritism. 
Vijay Shekhar

There are three welcome developments that have come out of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. One, we now have have a very strong Opposition that has been eluding us for a decade. 
Two, we may have a BJP government that has the chance to benefit from a coalition arrangement. 
Three, as a nation the electorate has attained a maturity that is getting scarcer in even established democracies elsewhere. 
People have authoritatively pushed to the front issues that are at the very core of their concerns. 
This will help the government in a course correction and a retuning of its policies. 
R Narayanan 
Navi Mumbai 

The election results, which were to usher in Modi 3.0, were unexpected. The exaggerated and high pitch campaigns of the political parties have crashed and shocked both NDA and I.N.D.I.A alliances. UP shocked. Even opinion and exit polls lost credibility this time. The governance will undergo a change with focus on the economy, development agenda, industry and job creation. Several minor alliance partners have dissipated. There are several surprises in the defeat of stalwarts. Two assembly election wins of NDA in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh will majorly transform NDA politics.PM Modi faces tough challenges in his third term. Subsequent elections should abandon caste and religious agenda. 
Vinod Johri 
New Delhi 

The results points to clarity in voters’ mind. The winners need not feel elated and the losers need not feel deflated as the margins of victory and defeat were so slender. 
Another message this election result gives is that people in general are not happy with the pro-rich policy that has been pursued in the last 10 years. There is a dire need to care for the middle class who cannot tighten their belts any further. Democracy survives better only in the presence of a strong opposition and absolute power given to any one party leads to authoritarian rule. 
Irrespective of the party that forms the government it is all the more important to keep in mind that enriching the rich, sharpening the communal divide and misusing the government agencies should be done away with. Focusing on employment, taming inflation and bridging the gap between the haves and the haves-not are to be prioritised, to avoid social conflict.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'The Atlantic'}",Vaibhav Vats,Many Indians Don’t Trust Their Elections Anymore,Modi rose from a level playing field that no longer exists.,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/05/india-election-democracy-modi/678336/?utm_source=feed,,2024-05-10T11:00:00Z,"Modi rose from a level playing field that no longer exists.
On March 21, a little less than a month before India’s national elections, the main opposition party, Congress, held a press conference to announce that its campaign was paralyzed. The government had earlier frozen the party’s bank accounts in connection with an alleged tax violation from the 1990s. Now the party was struggling to support its parliamentary candidates, and its ground organization had sputtered to a halt.
Later that evening, fewer than 10 miles away, cops and paramilitaries surrounded the official bungalow of Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi province and a member of another opposition party, seeking his arrest on corruption charges. His supporters began a spontaneous protest, and amid the frenzy, Kejriwal became the first sitting chief minister to be arrested in India’s history.
The events of March 21 are part of a pattern that has cast doubt on the legitimacy of India’s election. According to this year’s report by Freedom House, a bipartisan think tank that evaluates democracies across the world, Modi’s government “has selectively pursued anti-corruption investigations against opposition politicians while overlooking allegations against political allies.” Many of those politicians have then been cleared of the charges if they joined Modi’s party: Of 25 opposition leaders probed for corruption, 23 saw their charges dropped when they switched parties. These and other worrying developments are striking in a country that has long prided itself as the biggest and most unlikely modern democratic success story.
Ashoka Mody: Is India an autocracy?
India conducted its first election during the winter of 1951–2, a mammoth exercise that took five months to complete. For a nation that was overwhelmingly illiterate, poor, and racked by social divisions, the decision to adopt the universal adult franchise at one stroke was extraordinarily ambitious. Just preparing the country’s first electoral roll, enlisting 173 million voters, was a staggering undertaking—one actually completed before the constitution was even enacted in 1950. “Indians became voters before they were citizens,” the scholar Ornit Shani has written.
Indian elections have taken place, largely uninterrupted, ever since. Not only is this record rare among postcolonial nations; it is somewhat of a paradox within the context of India itself. Low indices for human development and shoddy public services testify to the country’s inefficiency on many counts, and yet, India has tended to organize the world’s largest elections with relative ease.
The country’s election commission is largely responsible for this success. The constitutional body has overseen 17 national elections and hundreds of provincial elections in states as large as European nations; today it caters to nearly 1 billion voters and marshals nearly 15 million workers to conduct a national election. The commission is led by a three-person panel whose chief, like a high-ranking judge, can be removed only if Parliament impeaches them. At least since the 1990s, chief election commissioners have been independent and powerful figures who inspire fear in politicians and their parties.
Narendra Modi has managed to undermine all that during his decade as prime minister. In December, his government passed a law amending the selection process for choosing election commissioners such that the executive branch would have the most say over the process. That he chose to interfere is little wonder. Independent election commissioners had posed an obstacle to Modi almost from the beginning of his political career.
When Modi was chief minister of the western state of Gujarat in 2002, a spasm of religious violence killed more than 1,000 people there, mostly Muslims. Modi dissolved the provincial assembly and called for elections six months ahead of schedule, likely hoping to capitalize on the climate of religious polarization that gripped the province. But J. M. Lyngdoh, then the chief election commissioner, visited Gujarat and concluded that local insecurity called for deferring elections until the winter. Modi responded by impugning Lyngdoh’s motivations and mocking his Christian identity.
By 2019, Modi had mostly taken care of this problem: He was ensconced as prime minister, and had rendered the election commission all but toothless, having filled the body with handpicked former bureaucrats closely allied with the Hindu right.
For decades, a stringent code of conduct governed elections in India, and transgressions could result in public censure, bans from campaigning, and, in extreme cases, the disqualification of candidates. And yet, in 2019, the commission heard five complaints against Modi for violating the election code—by seeking votes in the name of the military, for example, and appealing to the electorate on religious grounds. It somehow contrived to clear Modi in all five cases.
Five years later, Modi is leading an even more incendiary and divisive campaign, and the commission appears to be comatose. On April 6, Modi described the Congress party’s manifesto as reflecting the mentality of the Muslim League, the separatist organization that led to the creation of Pakistan and is widely reviled in India, even though the manifesto made no reference to religion. Then, in an election rally on April 21, Modi told voters that the Congress party intended to seize their private wealth and distribute it among India’s 200 million Muslims, whom he characterized as infiltrators producing more than their share of children.
Modi’s speech almost certainly violated not only the election code but also Indian laws against hate speech and inciting religious discord. Perhaps even Modi realized he had gone too far: The transcripts of the speech uploaded to the prime minister’s website did not include the most offensive passages. Even so, his remarks caused an uproar in India. Political parties and more than 20,000 private citizens complained to the election commission, seeking its intervention. If the electoral body did not act, Sagarika Ghose, an opposition legislator wrote on X, “then let’s please wind up the Election Commission and forget about the Model Code of Conduct.”
The commission responded timidly, with a notice not to Modi but to the president of his Bharatiya Janata Party. In the past, the commission directly censured political leaders for their violations; today its reluctance to confront the prime minister surprises no one. Commissioners know that standing up to Modi can exact a heavy price. In 2019, Ashok Lavasa, one of the three election commissioners, recorded a formal dissent from the decision to exonerate the prime minister on the five complaints. Lavasa’s phone was placed on a surveillance list, while his family endured months of harassment, including tax raids and investigations into his son’s business. In 2020, Lavasa resigned. He had been due to take over as chief election commissioner the following year.
I reached out to several former election commissioners for comment for this story. Two spoke with me off the record, kept deferring the date for a formal interview, and eventually stopped taking calls or responding to texts. One, Om Prakash Rawat, who was chief election commissioner in 2018, dismissed concerns about the commission’s independence as media fictions and suggested that Western democracies had perpetuated them in order to undermine India. Rawat told me that he did not think Modi and his party had violated the election code in 2019 or in the present election. Modi’s speech branding the Congress manifesto as reflecting the mentality of the Muslim League was merely politics as usual, he said.
As the election season has worn on and the commission has kept quiet, Modi has doubled down on his rhetoric, describing the Muslim electorate as “jihadi votes,” and the BJP has put out animated videos portraying Muslims as crafty and predatory animals.
Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi chief minister, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate, a federal agency that investigates financial crimes. Since Modi came to power in 2014, the number of investigations the directorate has conducted against political leaders has more than quadrupled, to 121. Of the leaders under investigation, 115 of them—95 percent—belonged to opposition parties.
Kejriwal is the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, an upstart populist outfit that has quickly risen to take charge of two northern provinces. A rousing orator, Kejriwal was known for his sarcastic and often humorous speeches critical of Modi. In the short term, arresting him served the BJP by eliminating a charismatic opposition politician from the campaign trail. In the long term, it dealt a blow to a rival who could one day become a national challenger.
Kejriwal was technically the first chief minister to be arrested in India’s history, but effectively, he was the second. In January, Hemant Soren, the chief minister of the eastern state of Jharkhand, had resigned a few hours before he was arrested by the directorate. Like Kejriwal, Soren had a commanding presence in a region where the BJP was markedly weak.
Few institutions have survived the democratic subversion of the Modi years. Soren and Kejriwal approached the courts, but an enfeebled judiciary is still vacillating on whether to grant them bail. Much of the mainstream news media purvey Hindu-nationalist propaganda, depicting Modi as the personification of the nation and his opponents as corrupt actors intent on destabilizing India. A recent analysis of six prominent networks from February through April, the months leading up to the election, found that 52 percent of their prime-time coverage attacked opposition parties; another 27 percent praised Modi and his government.
Under Modi, India has slipped 43 places down the World Press Freedom Index; it now ranks a dismal 159 out of 180 nations. Since 2021, Freedom House has categorized India as only “partly free” in its annual reports. That same year, the V-Dem Institute, an independent research organization based in Sweden, also reclassified India, observing that “the world’s largest democracy has turned into an electoral autocracy.”
These days in India, talk often swirls back to the Emergency, India’s previous era of authoritarian rule, in the 1970s under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The 1977 elections that ended the Emergency produced a staggering upset, with Gandhi losing her own parliamentary seat. But the Princeton professor Gyan Prakash, who wrote a book about the Emergency, told me that the analogy to the present moment was misleading. Gandhi freed opposition leaders from prison as elections approached; Modi has been doing the opposite.
“The 1977 elections were held fair and square,” Prakash told me. “One fears that is not going to be the case with 2024.”
In India’s stratified and deeply hierarchical society, elections have long been a great equalizer. During the campaign season, social boundaries between castes and classes seem momentarily to dissolve as passionate political debates break out in tea stalls and on crowded buses and subways. Candidates and parties produce festive road shows on city streets.
But Modi and his Hindu-nationalist juggernaut have quelled these energies. The current election feels sluggish. Most cities and towns have been bathed in the saffron hue of the BJP, and posters of Modi’s visage can be seen everywhere. Participation is correspondingly low; when voting began for more than 100 parliamentary seats on April 19, turnout was down more than three percentage points from five years ago.
Trust in the election commission is declining among voters; even fewer have confidence in the electronic machines used for voting. Making matters worse, this year’s turnout figures from the first round of voting were publicized a full 10 days later than normal, and they were expressed as percentages instead of whole numbers. Indian citizens rely on turnout data to assess the fairness of the vote. Now voters are openly voicing fears of sabotage; despite repeated appeals, the commission has not yet released the full figures.
The weakening of public faith in Indian elections is not surprising or accidental. The Hindu-nationalist movement has always been disdainful of Indian constitutionalism and democracy, seeing its participation in these processes as tactical accommodations on the path to its eventual goal of a centralized, authoritarian government. Commenting on India’s first election back in 1952, Organiser, the preeminent journal of the Hindu right, suggested that the country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, “would live to confess the failure of universal adult franchise in India.” Prakash told me that the government’s more recent ploys to throttle the opposition were part of the “BJP’s single-minded and ruthless drive for a one-party state.”
On April 22, a BJP candidate was elected unopposed from the Surat constituency in Gujarat, two weeks before elections were scheduled in the city of 1.8 million voters. The Congress candidate for the parliamentary seat had been rejected on a technicality; when the party put forward an alternative candidate, he was rejected too. Under mysterious circumstances, the remaining eight non-BJP candidates simultaneously withdrew from the race, paving the way for the BJP to win without a vote.
Vaibhav Vats: Violence is the engine of Modi’s politics
On the evening of the Surat victory, Jitendra Chauhan, an independent candidate from Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat, alleged in a video posted online that associates of the city’s sitting MP were threatening him, and that he feared he might even be killed if he didn’t withdraw his nomination. (The Gandhinagar MP is Amit Shah, India’s home minister and widely considered the second-most-powerful person in the country. The BJP denies Chauhan’s claims.) Over the following days, 16 candidates, including Chauhan, withdrew; many said they had faced pressure from powerful BJP politicians and even the police. Around the same time, in Indore, a Congress candidate went to the polling office to withdraw his nomination; when he emerged, he had joined the BJP.
Such strong-arm maneuvers offer one among several possible means of securing a one-party future. In January, during a mayoral election in the northern city of Chandigarh, a polling officer belonging to the BJP was caught on camera spoiling opposition ballots. That case resulted in a rare intervention: The election was overturned by India’s supreme court.
Through his decade in power, Modi has plowed the level playing field from which he rose. In 2014, when Modi led his insurgent campaign against the Congress, the media were free to robustly criticize the government, democratic institutions such as the election commission and the courts asserted themselves, and dissent did not carry the threat of prison. Now the very bodies the public once relied on to safeguard the electoral process have seemingly abdicated their constitutional mandate and are helping make Modi’s third bid for prime minister into something resembling a coronation.",-0.995,Negative,INC

BJP all set to fall short of absolute majority **INDIA bloc makes big gains ** Exit polls predictions proved wrong
NEW DELHI, June 4: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on Tuesday poised to form the government for a third consecutive term notwithstanding crushing losses in three Hindi heartland states after a bitterly fought election that was projected as a referendum on his popularity.
The Bharatiya Janata Party, whose candidates had contested in the name of Modi, won or was ahead in 240 seats and will fall short of the 272 majority mark and need the support of allies in the party-led National Democratic Alliance(NDA) for government formation, a far cry from the 303 and 282 seats it had won in 2019 and 2014 respectively to have a majority on its own.
With support from BJP’s key allies N Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP and Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), which were leading or winning 16 and 12 seats in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar respectively, and other alliance partners, the NDA appeared to be on course to bag around 290 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha. The TDP also swept the assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh dislodging Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s YSRCP.
Preparing to take office for a record equalling historic third term, Prime Minister Modi pledged to work with all states, regardless of the party in power, to build a developed India.
India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had served three consecutive terms.
In his first speech after the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Modi laid out his vision for the third term saying it would be a tenure of big decisions and key emphasis would be on uprooting corruption.
It is the first time that 73-year-old Modi will be dependent on allies to be in the government since he came into politics.
“The fight against corruption is becoming tougher by the day. Corruption is being shamelessly glorified for political interest. In our third term, NDA will focus a lot on rooting out corruption of all kinds,” Modi said.
Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge termed the poll outcome as the “victory of the people and that of democracy.”
“We had been saying that this battle is between public and Modi…This mandate is against Modi. This is his political and moral defeat. It is a big defeat for a person who sought votes in his own name. He has suffered a moral setback,” Kharge told reporters at the AICC headquarters flanked by Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi after the good showing by the Congress.
The elections also highlighted the revival of the main opposition Congress party under Rahul Gandhi, and the unexpected role of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh – under Akhilesh Yadav — as a giant slayer.
The trends and results did not throw up a landslide victory the BJP-led NDA had hoped for and what was projected by the exit polls. More than 640 million votes are to be counted in the world’s largest democratic exercise.
The NDA was stirred into life mostly around elections in the last 10 years as the BJP’s big majority and shrinking opposition in the Lok Sabha made its allies mostly redundant but this time around, allies will matter more than ever.
The Congress, which is part of the opposition INDIA alliance, was leading or winning 99 seats compared to 52 it won in 2019 eating into BJP’s share in Rajasthan and Haryana. The INDIA bloc won or was ahead in over 200 seats.
As SP chief Akhilesh Yadav kept the INDIA bloc morale high in Uttar Pradesh, the Trinamool Congress, another key ally of the opposition alliance, was leading or winning in 29 seats in West Bengal, higher than its 22 in 2019. The BJP, which had 18 seats in the last Lok Sabha election, was ahead in 12 seats.
In UP, the BJP won or was ahead in 33 seats as against its tally of 62 in 2019 and the SP’s numbers went up, largely attributed to three factors – consolidation of Muslim votes in favour of SP, smart seat sharing agreements with Congress to avoid splitting of non-BJP votes and widespread discontent with the BJP government over jobs and price rise. The SP was winning or leading in 37 of the 80 seats at stake.
Modi retained the Varanasi seat but with a reduced victory margin of nearly 1.53 lakh votes in Varanasi. In 2019, the margin was 4,79,505.
Rahul Gandhi, often lampooned by the BJP as ‘Shehzada’, won Wayanad(Kerala) and Rae Bareli(UP) seats by a huge margin of 3,64,422 votes and 3,90,030 votes respectively.
The campaigning for the elections, which were conducted from April 19 to June 1 in seven phases, was marked by divisive communal issues and excessive reliance on Modi for getting votes. The prime minister held more than 300 rallies, travelling tirelessly almost every day to multiple locations.
The results also blew away the BJP narrative that it will score big in the southern states this time. It, however, returned a tally of zero in Tamil Nadu, and lost seats in Karnataka.
The BJP did make inroads in Kerala, winning a seat for the first time in a state where the Congress and the Left are the major political force, and in Telangana where it won or was leading in 8 seats. Popular Malayalam actor Suresh Gopi won the Thrissur seat in Kerala to help the lotus bloom.
In Andhra Pradesh, BJP ally Telugu Desam Party won or was leading in 16 seats  and the BJP was ahead or winning in three.
The biggest setback for the BJP, which faced a stronger challenge from the opposition, however, was in the north where, besides UP, the BJP also faced losses  in Rajasthan and Haryana.
West Bengal also dealt the party a raw deal, although it more than made up for the losses in Odisha.
Madhya Pradesh went fully saffron with the BJP winning or leading in all 29 seats. In Gujarat, too, BJP was winning or leading in 25 of 26 seats.
The situation was not as decisive in other states.
In Bihar, the BJP was ahead in 12 and its partner JD-U in 13, a vote of confidence for its leader Nitish Kumar who swung from INDIA back to the NDA ahead of the elections. The RJD was poised to win four seats.
In Rajasthan, BJP was ahead only in 14 seats, against all 25 its alliance won last time. The Congress was ahead in eight.
Haryana also threw up a shock result for the BJP, where the party was leading only in five and the Congress in five. In 2019, the saffron party had bagged all 10.
It appeared that the election marked a return to regular politics, where voters were more concerned about bread and butter issues, especially in some Hindi heartland states where the opposition INDIA alliance managed to rally supporters around the issues of unemployment and price rise.
Maharashtra, with 48 Lok Sabha seats, saw the Shiv Sena split down the middle since the last election. The BJP, which won 23 seats five years ago, was down with leads in 11 seats, while its ally Shiv Sena could get seven.
On the other end of the spectrum, the Congress was ahead in 12 seats, up from one, and the Shiv Sena (UBT) in 19. The NCP Sharad Pawar faction could get seven seats, giving the INDIA alliance, forged together by the common dislike of the BJP, a possible 38 seats.
However, a silver lining was provided by Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Piyush Goyal who appeared on course to easy victories in Nagpur and Mumbai North respectively.
In Odisha, the BJP was doing spectacularly well, with leads in 19 out of 21 seats, while the ruling Biju Janata Dal was down to just one. It was also ahead in the Odisha assembly elections, leading in 76 out of 146 seats, a success show in the state it had never succeeded in capturing.
In Andhra Pradesh, the Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP was ahead in 16 seats of 25, the BJP in three and the YSRCP in four.
Trends for Karnataka showed potential gains for the Congress, with leads in nine seats, up from one last time. The BJP, which got 25 seats in 2019, was ahead in 17.
Tamil Nadu seemed to be scripting another story, not ceding any space to the saffron party. The ruling DMK was ahead in 22 and ally Congress in nine, a notch higher than their 2019 positions.(PTI)

NEW DELHI, June 4: Armed with the social justice plank and a slew of promises for welfare measures, the Congress made stunning gains with a spirited performance in the Lok Sabha polls that would not only silence its critics but also put the party on road to reclaiming its lost glory.
Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, former party chief Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra spearheaded an impressive campaign, underlining the welfare guarantees the party was offering to the people, but it was the push on social justice that seems to have made the difference with the weaker sections of the society seeming to have sided with the INDIA bloc in several BJP strongholds.
The opposition INDIA bloc led by the Congress appeared set to be a formidable force in the Parliament this time, though still possibly in opposition benches.
The Congress leaders attributed the party’s stunning comeback to its narrative focusing on issues of the people and its ‘Nyay’ guarantees.
Also, the top Congress leadership strongly raised the Congress’ claim at rallies that the BJP would change the Constitution which seems to have had a strong impact on the ground.
Another crucial aspect was the INDIA bloc fighting with unity at the hustings which brought it rich returns in states such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
Addressing a press conference here, Rahul Gandhi said that all Congress leaders respected the INDIA bloc allies and wherever the alliance fought “we fought as one”.
He also said the general election was a fight to save the Constitution.
“It was on my mind that the people of this country would rally together to save the Constitution. The first and biggest step towards saving the Constitution has been taken,” Gandhi said, adding that it was the poor and the marginalised who stood up to save the Constitution.
He added that the Congress and the INDIA bloc had given India a new pro-poor vision.
“The main thing this election has said, the country has said, is that we don’t want Narendra Modi, Amit Shah to be running this country,” Gandhi said.
After the campaign for the Lok Sabha polls ended, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had said the party set the narrative during the Lok Sabha polls with a sharp campaign that was devoid of “agar-magar, kintu parantu” and pushed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the “back foot”.
Ramesh said the first shot at creating a new narrative for the Congress was fired by Rahul Gandhi in the ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’. The yatra was held between September 2022 and January 2023.
The 144 days, 4,000-km walk from Kanyakumari to Kashmir was a very transformative movement for the Congress and for Indian politics, he said.
“He (Gandhi) constantly saying that ‘main nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan kholne aaya hu’ was the theme. What gave structure to the 2024 campaign was the ‘Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’ (this year) in which Gandhi had unveiled the ‘paanch nyay pachchees guarantee’,” Ramesh said.
He said the Congress’ ‘guarantee cards’, which state the party’s promises under the ‘Yuva Nyay, Kisaan Nyay, Nari Nyay, Shramik Nyay and the Hissedaari Nyay’ themes, made a major impact.
Political commentator and former Congress leader Sanjay Jha cited the BJP’s loss in the Lok Sabha seat of Ayodhya and said the people of Uttar Pradesh and India have rejected the politicization of religion.
“There is hope. Always. Never give up on the inherent goodness of humanity,” he said.
Though, the Congress pulled off a stunning upset, the question that lingers in the mind is — what if they had started early and not allowed to take the BJP a headstart in the campaign?
Political observers are of the opinion that it delayed seat-sharing among the INDIA bloc allies till the assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram in the hope that a good showing would hand it better bargaining power for seat-sharing.
However, the alliance did manage to get its act together as the elections were declared and ran an aggressive joint campaign, the results of which were seen in states such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
Going forward, the Congress, which was battling an exodus of leaders, will have to ensure that it builds on the gains as it is still in power on its own only in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Telangana.
The party would also need to look at a generational shift in leadership roles and Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi may need to step up in organizational responsibilities.
Many had begun writing the obituary of the Congress but its leaders insist that it is not a mere political party but it is an ideology, an idea, which cannot be finished off. (PTI)

 The mammoth exercise to count votes polled for the Lok Sabha seats in the 2024 elections will begin at 8 am on Tuesday.Trends and results will begin from 8 am today.
Results of the Assembly elections in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh were held simultaneously with voting for the 543-member Lok Sabha. Results of 175 Assembly constituencies in Andhra Pradesh and 147 Assembly constituencies in Odisha and results of bypolls in 25 Assembly constituencies will also be declared today.
Strict security has been put in place for the smooth conduct of counting of votes for over 8,000 candidates in this general elections.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will seek a third consecutive term in government, while the Congress-led opposition aims to unseat them.
Most exit polls have predicted a return of PM Modi to power, a development which will make him the first Prime Minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to secure a third successive term in power,
Meanwhile, a delegation of Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc leaders met with the Election Commission of India urging it to ensure that postal ballots are counted and their results declared before the outcome of the EVMs is announced.
Earlier, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar had said that a ""very robust system"" has been put in place. ""There are around 10.5 lakh booths. Each booth will have 14 tables. There are observers and micro-observers. Nearly, 70-80 lakh people are involved in the process,"" he said.
The national capital is all set to witness the battle. With tight security arrangements in place, Delhi is well-prepared to watch the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
Around 70 companies of the security forces will be deployed at all seven counting centres across the national capital as part of the elaborate security arrangements made by the Delhi Police for today.
Delhi traffic police issued a fresh advisory ahead of the counting of votes scheduled for Tuesday, listing key roads where traffic restrictions and diversions will start from 5 am onwards to ensure smooth vehicular movement.
Prime Minister Modi's hometown, Gujarat, is also preparing for the vote-counting day as security forces rehearse and perform drills for the effortless conduct of D-day. Exit polls have predicted the return of the BJP to power. Various exit polls have given the BJP more than 64 seats in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is poised for a hat-trick win in Lok Sabha polls with a massive majority. Exit polls were predicted on Saturday and indicated that the ruling party at the Centre would improve its performance in several states ruled by other parties.
A few exit polls predicted that the BJP-led NDA could reach the goal of ""400 paar"" stated by BJP leaders in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls. The exit polls predicted that the ruling BJP-led NDA is poised to improve its performance over its 2019 record when it won 352 seats.
Two polls predicted the BJP would also improve its numbers from the 303 seats it won in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
In the 2019 elections, NDA wrested 353 seats, of which the BJP won 303 alone. The Opposition's UPA got only 93 seats of which the Congress got 52.The Lok Sabha elections were conducted in seven phases- on April 19, April 26, May 7, May 13, May 20, May 25 and June 1.The counting trends and results, as per data entered by RO/ARO for AC/PC will be available on the ECI website as well as on the Voter Helpline App, both iOS and Android Mobile Apps, according to the ECI.
The Voter Helpline App can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or Apple Play Store. Users can use the available filter to find out the winning/leading or trailing candidate details, along with the constituency-wise or State-wise results from the Voter Helpline App.
The local display of the trends and results by the CEOs/ROs/DEOs may also be done through the Digital Display Panels, it said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he will form the next government for the third term, but he would need the support of allies after his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell short of the majority mark for the first time since 2014.
The BJP secured 240 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower House of the parliament, in a major electoral setback as the poll survey had projected the Hindu nationalist party to win by a bigger majority.
Parties from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the BJP have won 53 seats. Taken together the NDA has a strength of 293  21 seats more than the 272 mark needed to form the government.
The NDA allies, many of whom have a history of flip-flops, convened for a meeting on Wednesday, after which they backed the BJP and Modi to lead the next government.
Heres more about the biggest NDA allies and their history of alliance with the BJP in the past.

India is bracing itself for the fourth phase of its weeks-long elections on May 13 to elect 96 members of parliament to the Lok Sabha, or the lower house of parliament, as the worlds largest electoral exercise moves into its final month.
The two main contenders for power are Prime Minister Narendra Modis governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of 26 parties led by the main opposition party, Rahul Gandhis Indian National Congress.
Last week, the third phase of the voting saw Modi cast his vote in Gujarats Gandhinagar constituency. It also saw the competition between the two main contenders heighten as the Congress Partys former President Sonia Gandhi said Modi and the BJP were focusing only on gaining power at any cost.
The fourth phase also features a bit of glamour in the east of the country, where Bollywood veteran Shatrughan Sinha is seeking re-election in West Bengals Asansol, and to the south, where actress Maadhavi Latha from the BJP is standing for the Hyderabad seat in Telangana. Latha is pitted against Asaduddin Owaisi, a four-time MP from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party.

The first three phases of the election, which were held on April 19, April 26 and May 7, saw a voter turnout of 66.1, 66.7, and 61 percent, respectively. The voting so far has been lower than in the 2019 elections. In total, 969 million people are registered to vote in 543 parliamentary constituencies across 36 states and federally-governed union territories.
Registered voters across nine states and a union territory will cast their ballots for the following constituencies:
Hyderabad (Telangana): Asaduddin Owaisi is being challenged by the BJPs Maadhavi Latha in his family bastion. Owaisis brother, Akbaruddin Owaisi is a member of the state legislative assembly while his father, Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi, represented the parliamentary constituency, with a substantial Muslim population, six times. Owaisi pitches himself as the voice of Indias Muslim minority whose issues he regularly raises in his parliamentary debates. Owaisi was given the best parliamentarian award in 2022.
Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir): This constituency in Kashmir registered just 15 percent voting in the 2019 election, which was marred by a boycott. This is the first parliamentary election in Kashmir since the regions special status was removed in August 2019. The two biggest mainstream pro-India parties in the region  the National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party  have fielded Aga Syed and Waheed Parra, respectively, as their candidates.
 

 
Krishnanagar, Baharampur and Asansol (West Bengal): These three parliamentary contests in West Bengal state, bordering Bangladesh, offer a mix of star power and political significance. Bollywood actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha is seeking re-election from Asansol, while ex-cricketer Yusuf Pathan is taking on senior Congress Party leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who has been representing Bahrampur since 1999. Chowdhury was also the leader of the opposition Congress Party in the outgoing Lok Sabha. Pathan is the candidate of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the party that rules the state and is also aligned with the national opposition INDIA alliance  even though the coalitions members are standing against each other in West Bengal.
Yet, the most high-profile electoral battle in the state on May 13, is in Krishnanagar, where the fiery TMC parliamentarian and fierce critic of Modi, Mahua Moitra, is seeking a second term. A former vice president of JPMorgan Chase based in London, Moitra entered politics in 2009. Her parliamentary speeches asking tough questions of the government often go viral. In December 2023, the firebrand MP was expelled from parliament after being accused of accepting cash to ask questions. She said her expulsion was a way to silence her. She has challenged her expulsion in the Supreme Court. The BJP has fielded Amrita Roy, whose husband is a descendant of the erstwhile king of the region, against Moitra.
Kannauj and Lakhimpur Kheri (Uttar Pradesh): Akhilesh Yadav, the leader of the Samajwadi Party  a regional powerhouse that has seen its influence shrink with the BJPs rise  has decided to enter the electoral race in Kannauj in northern Uttar Pradesh state, which accounts for 80 seats in the parliament. The BJP currently governs the state. Kannauj, known for its perfume industry, has been a Yadav family bastion. Akhilesh, his father Mulayan Singh Yadav and his wife Dimple Yadav have represented the seat since 1999. But in 2019, Dimple lost to the BJP in a shock defeat. Akhileshs entry into the electoral fray is an attempt to wrest back the family pocket borough.
The other seat that has attracted a lot of attention is Lakhimpur Kheri, where controversial federal Minister of Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni is seeking re-election. Mishra has been caught in a storm since his son Ashish Mishra allegedly ran his car over farmers protesting against now-repealed farm laws. Ashish is out on bail and farmers groups as well as activists have been demanding that Mishra be denied a ticket by the BJP.
Indore (Madhya Pradesh): This constituency, a stronghold of the BJP, has been in the news for unlikely reasons. The Congress candidate Akshay Kanti Bam withdrew from the race at the last minute, after the last date for candidates to file nominations had passed. The Congress could not field a replacement and Bam later joined the BJP. Thirteen other candidates are in the fray, but the Congress Party has urged voters to opt for NOTA (none of the above) in protest.
 

 
Voting will begin at 7am local time (01:30 GMT) and end at 6pm (12:30 GMT). Voters already in the queue by the time polls close will get to vote, even if that means keeping polling stations open longer.
Complete election results for all phases are to be released on June 4.

 
The first three phases of the Lok Sabha elections have already decided the fate of 284 MPs.
So far, voting has concluded for all seats in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Meghalaya, Assam, Manipur, Karnataka, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura; the Andaman and Nicobar islands; and the Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman, Diu, Lakshadweep and Puducherry union territories.
The fifth phase will kick off on May 20 and the sixth on May 25, before the election heads towards the seventh and final phase on June 1.

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi took oath for the third consecutive time at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Sunday evening, his trusted confidant Amit Shah was inducted into the Union Cabinet. 
President Draupadi Murmu swore in Amit Anilchandra Shah as a minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet.
Shah was the second minister to be sworn in after Rajnath Singh. The 59-year-old BJP leader and the party's key strategist served as the Union Home Minister in the previous Modi government.
Shah had won Gujarat's Gandhinagar seat by a huge margin of 7,44,716 votes. Shah gathered 10,10,972 votes beating Congress' Sonal Patel who got 2,66,256.
In the 2023 Lok Sabha elections, he won Gujarat's Gandhinagar seat by a huge margin of 7,44,716 votes. Shah gathered 10,10,972 votes beating Congress' Sonal Patel who got 2,66,256.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Shah won with a margin of 5,57,014 votes. The seat was previously held by BJP veterans like LK Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
One of his significant achievements during his term as Union Home Minister in the previous Narendra Modi government, was the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir and he played an important role in the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which aimed to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
Shah was appointed as BJP's national president in 2014 and held the post till the year 2020.
Amit Shah's public life began at the age of 16 in 1980 when he joined as a young Swayamsevak of the Sangh. In the meantime, he also was associated with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi. In 1982, Shah was made joint secretary of the Gujarat unit of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.
He also worked for the BJP in 1984 as a polling agent for the Sanghvi booth of Narayanpur ward. In the year 1987, Amitbhai Anilchandra Shah joined the Yuva Morcha of the BJP.
In 1989, Amit Shah became BJP secretary of the BJP's Ahmedabad unit.
In 1997, Shah was made the National Treasurer of the Bharatiya Janata Party's Yuva Morcha. In the same year, in the Sarkhej assembly by-election, the party nominated him as its candidate and he became MLA for the first time winning by a margin of 25,000 votes. Since then, Amitbhai Anilchandra Shah continued to win every assembly election till 2012 and the margin of his victory increased in each of them.
In 1998, he became the state secretary of Gujarat BJP and within a year he was given the responsibility of the state vice-president.
Shah was given an important responsibility by the party in the 'Gaurav-Yatra' organized for the first time in the 2002 assembly elections in Gujarat under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi. BJP won the Gujarat assembly elections and Amitbhai Anilchandra Shah became a minister in the government.
In the 2014 elections, when the BJP made Narendra Modi its prime ministerial candidate, Amit Shah was sent as the in-charge of the politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh. Shah was made the National President of BJP on 9 July 2014. His first term lasted till 2020. Shah became the Home Minister in the Modi government which was re-elected in 2019.

The Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) target of achieving a hat-trick of clean sweeps in Gujarat came undone Tuesday, after it conceded the Banaskantha Lok Sabha seat to its rival Congress.
For the first time since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, the BJP has lost a Lok Sabha seat in Gujarat, winning 25 of the 26 seats in the State. The saffron party had won all the 26 seats during the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections and had targeted to win all the 26 seats with a victory margin of 5 lakh votes.
The BJP candidate from Patan, Bharatsinhji Dabhi, narrowly won the Patan seat with little over 30,000 votes where Congress candidate Chandan Thakor was leading the counting till 2 pm. The Banaskantha seat too witnessed a see-saw battle between Congress Geniben Thakor and her BJP rival Rekhaben Chaudhari. It was Thakor who finally emerged victorious with a margin of 30,000 votes.
The BJP bagged a vote share of over 61.86 percent, while Congress  which fought the 2024 LS polls in Gujarat in alliance with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)  had a vote share of around 31.24 percent. This is the first time in 10 years that Congress has won a Lok Sabha seat from Gujarat. The AAP  which fought on Bharuch and Bhavnagar seats  finished with a vote share of 2.69 percent. In 2019, the BJP had secured 62.26 percent of the total votes polled, while Congress had a vote share of 32.4 percent. 
Shaktisinh Gohil, President of Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) told media persons, They (BJP) had claimed that they will score a hat-rick in Gujarat and win all the seats by a margin of 5 lakh votes. Leaving aside one or two seats, they did not get any such lead. I thank the people of Banaskantha that they have sent a daughter from Banas to the Parliament. Thanking the Congress workers, Gohil said many of the Congress candidates in Gujarat fought the Lok Sabha polls through crowd-funding as the party faced funding issues. 
For the BJP in Gujarat, the biggest victory margin was pocketed by BJP President and sitting MP from Navsari, CR Patil, who won with a margin of 7.73 lakh votes. Union Home minister Amit Shah stood second securing a victory margin of over 7.44 lakh more votes. Another Union minister (for health) Mansukh Mandaviya won from Porbandar with a margin of 3.8 lakh votes. Similarly, Union Minister of State Devusinh Chauhan who had contested from Kheda won by 3.5 lakh vote margin.
The Kshatriya anger against BJP and its candidate Union minister (for Dairying and Animal Husbandry) Parshottam Rupala  who made comments against the community during an election rally and later apologised  had little impact on the final outcome of the Lok Sabha polls in Gujarat as Rupala won from the Rajkot seat with a victory margin of over 4.84 lakh votes. The Kshatirya community had demanded Rupalas removal as a BJP candidate after the controversy broke out. However, BJP stuck with Rupala. Even in a seat like Anand which had a significant Kshatriya population, the sitting BJP MP Mitesh Patel won with a margin of over 89,000 votes. 
BJP officials said that Gujarat continued to remain the fortress for the party despite loss of one seat. The way the people have voted in support of the party, the foundation of the party remains strong in the state, said a BJP spokesperson. 
On Tuesday, the counting was held only for 25 of the 26 seats as the BJP candidate Mukesh Dalal had won the Surat seat uncontested. This happened after nominations of the Congress candidate on the Surat seat got rejected by the Election Commission and the other nominees in the fray pulled back their nomination forms. 
Meanwhile, the counting for bypolls held for five assembly seats in Gujarat  Vijapur, Porbandar, Manavadar, Khambhat and Waghodia  BJP candidates emerged victorious. These victories will help raise the strength of BJP in the 182-member assembly to 161. Congress will have only 12 MLAs, as Geniben is expected to move to the Centre. In the assembly, AAP will have 4 MLAs, Samajwadi Party one MLA and two independents.

No one knows why the Hohokam Indians vanished. They had carved hundreds of miles of canals in the Sonoran Desert with stone tools and channeled the waters of the Salt and Gila Rivers to irrigate their crops for a thousand years until, in the middle of the 15th century, because of social conflict or climate changedrought, floodstheir technology became obsolete, their civilization collapsed, and the Hohokam scattered. Four hundred years later, when white settlers reached the territory of southern Arizona, they found the ruins of abandoned canals, cleared them out with shovels, and built crude weirs of trees and rocks across the Salt River to push water back into the desert. Aware of a lost civilization in the Valley, they named the new settlement Phoenix.

It grew around water. In 1911, Theodore Roosevelt stood on the steps of the Tempe Normal School, which, half a century later, would become Arizona State University, and declared that the soaring dam just completed in the Superstition Mountains upstream, established during his presidency and named after him, would provide enough water to allow 100,000 people to live in the Valley. There are now 5 million.
The Valley is one of the fastest-growing regions in America, where a developer decided to put a city of the future on a piece of virgin desert miles from anything. At night, from the air, the Phoenix metroplex looks like a glittering alien craft that has landed where the Earth is flat and wide enough to host it. The street grids and subdivisions spreading across retired farmland end only when theyre stopped by the borders of a tribal reservation or the dark folds of mountains, some of them surrounded on all sides by sprawl.
Phoenix makes you keenly aware of human artificeits ingenuity and its fragility. The American lust for new things and new ideas, good and bad ones, is most palpable here in the West, but the dynamo that generates all the microchip factories and battery plants and downtown high-rises and master-planned suburbs runs so high that it suggests its own oblivion. New Yorkers and Chicagoans dont wonder how long their cities will go on existing, but in Phoenix in August, when the heat has broken 110 degrees for a month straight, the desert golf courses and urban freeways give this civilization an air of impermanence, like a mirage composed of sheer hubris, and a surprising number of inhabitants begin to brood on its disappearance.
Growth keeps coming at a furious pace, despite decades of drought, and despite political extremism that makes every election a crisis threatening violence. Democracy is also a fragile artifice. It depends less on tradition and law than on the shifting contents of individual skullsbelief, virtue, restraint. Its durability under natural and human stress is being put to an intense test in the Valley. And because a vision of vanishing now haunts the whole country, Phoenix is a guide to our future.
Among the white settlers who rebuilt the Hohokam canals were the Mormon ancestors of Rusty Bowers. In the 1890s, they settled in the town of Mesa, east of Phoenix and a few miles downstream from where the Verde River joins the Salt. In 1929, when Bowerss mother was a little girl, she was taken to hear the Church president, believed to be a prophet. For the rest of her life, she would recall one thing he told the assembly: I foresee the day when there will be lines of people leaving this valley because there is no water.
The Valleys several thousand square miles stretch from Mesa in the east to Buckeye in the west. Bowers lives on a hill at Mesas edge, about as far east as you can go before the Valley ends, in a pueblo-style house where he and his wife raised seven children. He is lean, with pale-blue eyes and a bald sunspotted head whose pinkish creases and scars in the copper light of a desert sunset give him the look of a figure carved from the sandstone around him. So his voice comes as a surpriseplayful cadences edged with a husky sadness. He trained to be a painter, but instead he became one of the most powerful men in Arizona, a 17-year state legislator who rose to speaker of the House in 2019. The East Valley is conservative and so is Bowers, though he calls himself a pintoa spotted horsemeaning capable of variations. When far-right House members demanded a 30 percent across-the-board budget cut, he made a deal with Democrats to cut far less, and found the experience one of the most liberating of his life. He believes that environmentalists worship Creation instead of its Creator, but he drives a Prius as well as a pickup.
In the late 2010s, the Arizona Republican Party began to worry Bowers with its growing radicalism: State meetings became vicious free-for-alls; extremists unseated mainstream conservatives. Still, he remained a member in good standingappearing at events with Donald Trump during the presidents reelection campaign, handing out Trump flyers door-to-dooruntil the morning of Sunday, November 22, 2020.
Bowers and his wife had just arrived home from church when the Priuss Bluetooth screen flashed WHITE HOUSE. Rudy Giuliani was calling, and soon afterward the freshly defeated president came on the line. As Bowers later recalled, there was the usual verbal backslapping, Trump telling him what a great guy he was and Bowers thanking Trump for helping with his own reelection. Then Giuliani got to the point. The election in Arizona had been riddled with fraud: piles of military ballots stolen and illegally cast, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens and dead people voting, gross irregularities at the counting centers. Bowers had been fielding these stories from Republican colleagues and constituents and found nothing credible in them.
Do you have proof of that? Bowers asked.
Yeah, Giuliani replied.
Do you have names?
Oh yeah.
I need proof, names, how they voted, and I need it on my desk.
Rudy, Trump broke in, give the man what he wants.
Bowers sensed some further purpose to the call. To what end? Whats the ask here?
Rudy, whats the ask? Trump echoed, as if he didnt know.
Americas ex-mayor needed Bowers to convene a committee to investigate the evidence of fraud. Then, according to an arcane state law that had been brought to Giulianis attention by someone high up in Arizona Republican circles, the legislature could replace the states Biden electors with a pro-Trump slate.
The car was idling on the dirt driveway by a four-armed saguaro cactus. Thats a new one, Bowers said. Ive never heard that one before. You need to tell me more about that.
Giuliani admitted that he personally wasnt an expert on Arizona law, but hed been told about a legal theory, which turned out to have come from a paper written by a 63-year-old state representative and avid Trump partisan named Mark Finchem, who was studying for a late-in-life masters degree at the University of Arizona.
Were asking you to consider this, Trump told Bowers.
Mr. President 
Bowers prayed a lot, about things large and small. But prayer doesnt deliver instant answers. So that left conscience, which everyone is blessed with but some do their best to kill. An immense number of Trump-era Republican officeholders had killed theirs in moments like this one. Bowers, who considered the Constitution divinely inspired, felt his conscience rising up into his throat: Dont do it. Youve got to tell him you wont do it.
I swore an oath to the Constitution, Bowers said.
Well, you know, Giuliani said, were all Republicans, and we need to be working together.
Mr. President, Bowers said, I campaigned for you. I voted for you. The policies you put in did a lot of good. But I will do nothing illegal for you.
Were asking you to consider this, Trump again told Bowers.
At the end of November, Trumps legal team flew to Phoenix and met with Republican legislators. Bowers asked Giuliani for proof of voter fraud. We dont have the evidence, Giuliani said, but we have a lot of theories. The evidence never materialized, so the state party pushed the theories, colleagues in the legislature attacked Bowers on Twitter, and a crowd swarmed the capitol in December to denounce him. One of the most vocal protesters was a young Phoenix man a month away from world fame as the QAnon Shaman.
On December 4, Bowers wrote in his diary:
Caravans of trucks climbed the road to Bowerss house with pro-Trump flags and video panels and loudspeakers blasting to his neighbors that he was corrupt, a traitor, a pervert, a pedophile. His daughter Kacey, who had struggled with alcoholism, was now dying, and the mob outside the house upset her. At one point, Bowers went out to face them and encountered a man in a Three Percenter T-shirt, with a semiautomatic pistol on his hip, screaming abuse. Bowers walked up close enough to grab the gun if the Three Percenter drew. I see you brought your little pop gun, he said. You gonna shoot me? Yell all you wantdont touch that gun. He knew that it would take only one would-be patriot under the influence of hateful rhetoric to kill him. He would later tell the January 6 congressional committee: The country is at a very delicate part where this veneer of civilization is thinner than my fingers pressed together.
Emails poured in. On December 7, someone calling themselves hunnygun wrote:
Three days before Christmas, Bowers was sitting on his patio when Trump called againthis time without his attorney, and with a strange message that might have been an attempt at self-exculpation. I remember what you told me the last time we spoke, Trump said. Bowers took this as a reference to his refusal to do anything illegal, which he repeated. I get it, Trump said. I dont want you to. He thanked Bowers for his support during the campaign. I hope your family has a merry Christmas.
Kacey Bowers died at age 42 on January 28, 2021. COVID rules kept the family from her hospital bedside until her final hours. Bowers, a lay priest in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, gave his daughter a blessing, and at the very end, the family sang a hymn by John Henry Newman:
The gloom thickened. Bowerss enemies launched an effort to recall him, with foot soldiers provided by the Trump youth organization Turning Point USA, which is headquartered in Phoenix. The recall failed, but it was an ill omen. That summer, a wildfire in the mountains destroyed the Bowers ranch, taking his library, his papers, and many of his paintings. In 2022, after Bowers testified before the January 6 committee in Washington, D.C., the state party censured him and another stream of abuse came to his doorstep. Term-limited in the House, he ran for a Senate seat just to let the party know that it couldnt bully him out. He was demolished by a conspiracist with Trumps backing. Bowerss political career was over.
What do you do? Bowers said. You stand up. Thats all you can do. You have to get back up. When we lost the place and saw the house was still burning and now theres nothing there, gone, and to have 23-plus years of a fun place with the family to be goneits hard. Is it the hardest? No. Not even close. I keep on my phone (I wont play it for you) my last phone call from my daughterhow scared she was, a port came out of her neck, they were transporting her, she was bleeding all over, and she says: Dad, please, help me, please! Compared to a phone call from the president, compared to your house burning down? So what? What do you do, Dad? Those are hard things. But they come at us all. Theyre coming at us as a country  What do we do? You get up.
Bowers went back to painting. He took a job with a Canadian water company called EPCOR. Water had obsessed him all his lifehe did not want the prophets vision to come to pass on his watch. One bright day last October, we stood on the Granite Reef Diversion Dam a few miles from his house, where the two main water systems that nourish the Valley meet at the foot of Red Mountain, sacred to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indians, whose reservation stood just across the dry bed of the river. Below the dams headgate three-foot carp thrashed in the turbulent water of the South Canal, and wild horses waded in the shallows upstream.
Whats the politics of water here? I asked.
Bowers laughed, incredulous. Oh my gosh, that question. Its everywhere. Youve heard the dictum.
I had heard the dictum from everyone in the Valley who thought about the subject. Whiskeys for drinking
Waters for fighting, Bowers finished, and then he amended it: Waters for killing.
Summer in the Valley for most of its inhabitants is like winter in Minnesotaor winter in Minnesota 20 years ago. People stay inside as much as possible and move only if absolutely necessary among the artificial sanctuaries of home, car, and work. Young professionals in the arts district emerge after dark to walk their dogs. When the sun is high, all human presence practically disappears from the streets, and you notice how few trees there are in Phoenix.
Frank Lloyd Wright disliked air-conditioning. During a visit to Taliesin West, the home and studio he built from desert stone in the 1930s on a hillside north of Phoenix, I read in his book The Natural House?:
The observation gets at the unnaturalness of the Valley, because its civilization is unthinkable without air-conditioning. But the massive amount of energy required to keep millions of people alive in traffic jams is simultaneously burning them up, because air-conditioning accounts for 4 percent of the worlds greenhouse-gas emissions, twice that of all aviation.
One morning last August, goaded by Wright and tired of air-conditioned driving, I decided to walk the mile from my hotel to an interview at the Maricopa County Recorders Office. Construction workers were sweating and hydrating on the site of a new high-rise. A few thin figures slouched on benches by the Valley Metro tracks. At a bus shelter, a woman lay on the sidewalk in some profound oblivion. After four blocks my skin was prickling and I thought about turning back for my rental car, but I couldnt face suffocating at the wheel while I waited for the air to cool. By the time I reached the Recorders Office, I was having trouble thinking, as if Id moved significantly closer to the sun.
Last summerwhen the temperature reached at least 110 degrees on 55 days (above 110, people said, it all feels the same), and the midsummer monsoon rains never came, and Phoenix found itself an object of global horrorheat officially helped kill 644 people in Maricopa County. They were the elderly, the sick, the mentally ill, the isolated, the homeless, the addicted (methamphetamines cause dehydration and fentanyl impairs thought), and those too poor to own or fix or pay for air-conditioning, without which a dwelling can become unlivable within an hour. Even touching the pavement is dangerous. A woman named Annette Vasquez, waiting in line outside the NourishPHX food pantry, lifted her pant leg to show me a large patch of pink skin on her calfthe scar of a second-degree burn from a fall shed taken during a heart attack in high heat after seven years on the streets.
Read: The problem with Why do people live in Phoenix?
It was 115 on the day I met Dr. Aneesh Narang at the emergency department of BannerUniversity Medical Center. He had already lost four or five patients to heatstroke over the summer and just treated one who was brought in with a body temperature of 106 degrees, struggling to breathe and unable to sweat. Patients coming in at 108, 109 degreestheyve been in the heat for hours, theyre pretty much dead, Narang said. We try to cool them down as fast as we can. The method is to strip off their clothes and immerse them in ice and tap water inside a disposable cadaver bag to get their temperature down to 100 degrees within 15 or 20 minutes. But even those who survive heatstroke risk organ failure and years of neurological problems.
Recently, a hyperthermic man had arrived at Narangs emergency department lucid enough to speak. He had become homeless not long before and was having a hard time surviving in the heatshelters werent open during the day, and he didnt know how to find the citys designated cooling centers. I cant keep up with this, he told the doctor. I cant get enough water. Im tired.
Saving a homeless patient only to send him back out into the heat did not feel like a victory to Narang. Its a Band-Aid on a leaking dam, he said. We havent solved a deep-rooted issue here. Were sending them back to an environment that got them herethats the sad part. The only change that helps that situation is ending homelessness. Its a problem in a city thatll get hotter and hotter every year. Im not sure what itll look like in 2050.
The mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego, has a degree in environmental science and has worked on water policy in the region. We are trying to very much focus on becoming a more sustainable community, she told me in her office at city hall. Her efforts include the appointment of one of the countrys first heat czars; zoning and tax policies to encourage housing built up rather than out (downtown Phoenix is a forest of cranes); a multibillion-dollar investment in wastewater recycling; solar-powered shipping containers used as cooling centers and temporary housing on city lots; and a shade campaign of trees, canopies, and public art on heavily walked streets.
But the homeless population of metro Phoenix has nearly doubled in the past six years amid a housing shortage, soaring rents, and NIMBYism; multifamily affordable housing remain dirty words in most Valley neighborhoods. Nor is there much a mayor can do about the rising heat. A scientific study published in May 2023 projected that a blackout during a five-day heat wave would kill nearly 1 percent of Phoenixs populationabout 13,000 peopleand send 800,000 to emergency rooms.
Near the airport, on the treeless streets south of Jefferson and north of Grant, there was a no-mans-land around the lonely tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad, with scrap metal and lumber yards, stacks of pallets, a food pantry, abandoned wheelchairs, tombstones scattered across a dirt cemetery, and the tents and tarps and belongings and trash of the homeless. I began to think of this area, in the dead center of the Valley, as the heat zone. It felt hotter than anywhere else, not just because of the pavement and lack of shade, but because this was where people who couldnt escape the furnace came. Most were Latino or Black, many were past middle age, and they came to be near a gated 13-acre compound that offered meals, medical and dental care, information about housing, a postal address, and 900 beds for single adults.
Last summer, the homeless encampment outside the compound stretched for several desolate blocksthe kind of improvised shantytown Ive seen in Manila and Lagos but not in the United States, and not when the temperature was 111 degrees. One day in August, with every bed inside the compound taken, 563 people in varying states of consciousness were living outside. I couldnt understand what kept them from dying.
Read: When will the Southwest become unlivable?
Mary Gilbert Todd, in her early 60s, from Charleston, South Carolina, had a cot inside Respiro, a large pavilion where men slept on one side, women on the other. Before that shed spent four years on the streets of Phoenix. Her face was sunburned, her upper teeth were missing, and she used a walker, but her eyes gleamed bright blue with energy.
If you put a wet shirt on and wet your hair, its gonna be cool, she told me cheerfully, poking with a fork at a cup of ramen. In the daytime, you dont wanna walk. Its better, when youre homeless, to find a nice, shady tree and build yourself a black tent that you can sleep in where theres some breeze. The black, it may absorb more heat on the outside, but its going to provide more shade. Here you got the dry heat. You want to have an opening so wind can go throughsomething that the police arent going to notice too much. Because if youre in a regular tent, theyre gonna come bust you, and if youre sitting out in the open, theyre gonna come mess with you. She said that shed been busted for urban camping 600 times.
My guide around the compound was Amy Schwabenlender, who directs it with the wry, low-key indignation of a woman working every day in the trenches of a crisis that the country appears readier to complain about than solve. Its Americawe dont have to have homelessness, she said. We allow homelessness to happen. Wethe big we. The neighborsa casket maker, an electric-parts supplier, the owners of a few decaying housesblamed Schwabenlender for bringing the problem to their streets, as if she were the root cause of homelessness. In the face of a lawsuit, the city was clearing the encampment.
Schwabenlender had come to the Valley to get away from depressing Wisconsin winters. After her first night in a motel in Tempe, she went out to her car and found the window heat-glued to the door by its rubber seal. What did I just do to myself? she wondered. Now she lives in North Phoenix in a house with a yard and a pool, but she has seen enough misery to be a growth dissident.
I dont know why people want to live here, she said, smiling faintly, her pallor set off by thick black hair. We cant have enough housing infrastructure for everyone who wants to live here. So why are we celebrating and encouraging more business? Why are we giving large corporations tax breaks to move here? How can we encourage people to come here when we dont have enough housing for the people who are here, and we dont have enough water? It doesnt add up to me.
While we were talking, a woman with a gray crew cut who was missing her left leg below the thigh rolled up to Schwabenlender in a wheelchair. She had just been released after a long prison term and had heard something that made her think shed get a housing voucher by the end of the month.
Schwabenlender gave an experienced sigh. Theres a waitlist of 4,000, she told the woman.
On my way out of Respiro, I chatted with a staff member named Tanish Bates. I mentioned the woman Id seen lying on the sidewalk by the bus shelter in the heat of the dayshe had seemed beyond anyones reach. Why didnt you talk to her? Bates asked. For me, its a natural instinctIm going to try. You ask them, Whats going on? What do you need? Do you need water? Should I call the fire department? Nothing beats failure but a try. She gave me an encouraging pat. Next time, ask yourself what you would want.
Utterly shamed, I walked out into the heat zone. By the compounds gate, a security guard stood gazing at the sky. A few lonely raindrops had begun to fall. I been praying for rain, she said. I am so tired of looking at the sun. People were lining up to spend an hour or two in a city cooling bus parked at the curb. Farther down Madison Street, the tents ended and street signs announced: THIS AREA IS CLOSED TO CAMPING TO ABATE A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
Every time I returned to Phoenix, I found fewer tents around the compound. The city was clearing the encampment block by block. In December, only a few stragglers remained outside the gatethe hardest cases, fading out on fentanyl or alert enough to get into fights. They keep coming back, said a skinny, shirtless young man named Brandon Bisson. Theyre like wild animals. Theyll keep coming back to where the food and resources are. Homeless for a year, he was watering a pair of healthy red bougainvillea vines in front of a rotting house where hed been given a room with his dog in exchange for labor. Bisson wanted a job working with animals.
Theres no news story anymore, Schwabenlender said as she greeted me in her office. The city had opened a campground where 15th Avenue met the railroad tracks, with shipping containers and tents behind screened fencing, and 41 people were now staying there. Others had been placed in hotels. But it was hard to keep tabs on where they ended up, and some people were still out on the street, in parks, in cars, under highway overpasses. How do we keep the sense of urgency? Schwabenlender murmured in her quizzical way, almost as if she were speaking to herself. We didnt end homelessness. The housing waitlist for Maricopa County stood at 7,503. The heat was over for now.
Civilization in the Valley depends on solving the problem of water, but because this has to be done collectively, solving the problem of water depends on solving the problem of democracy. My visits left me with reasons to believe that human ingenuity is equal to the first task: dams, canals, wastewater recycling, underground storage, desalination, artificial intelligence. But I found at least as many reasons to doubt that we are equal to the second.
Its easy to believe that the Valley could double its population when youre flying in a helicopter over the dams of the Salt River Project, the public utility whose lakes hold more than 2 million acre-feet650 trillion gallonsof water; and when Mayor Gallego is describing Phoenixs multibillion-dollar plan to recycle huge quantities of wastewater; and when Stephen Roe Lewis, the leader of the Gila River Indian Community, is walking through a recharged wetland that not long ago had been barren desert, pointing out the indigenous willows and cattails whose fibers are woven into traditional bracelets like the one around his wrist.
But when you see that nothing is left of the mighty Colorado River as it approaches the Mexican border but dirt and scrub; and when you drive by a road sign south of the Valley that says EARTH FISSURES POSSIBLE because the water table is dropping four feet a year; and when sprinklers are watering someones lawn in Scottsdale in the rainthen the prophets vision feels a little closer.
American sprawl across the land of the disappeared Hohokam looks flimsy and flat and monotonous amid the deserts sublime Cretaceous humps. But sprawl is also the sight of ordinary people reaching for freedom in 2,000 square feet on a quarter acre. Growth is an orthodox faith in the Valley, as if the only alternative is slow death.
Once, I was driving through the desert of far-northern Phoenix with Dave Roberts, the retired head of water policy for the Salt River Project. The highway passed a concrete fortress rising in the distance, a giant construction site with a dozen cranes grasping the sky. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Companys three plants would employ 6,000 people; they would also consume billions of gallons of Phoenixs water every year. Roberts filled in the empty space around the site: All this desert land will be apartments, homes, golf courses, and who knows whatCostcos. Theres going to be malls out here. Gobs of people. As long as people in places like Louisiana and Mississippi wanted to seek a better life in the Valley, who was he to tell them to stay away? A better life was the whole point of growth.
I asked Roberts, an intensely practical man, if he ever experienced apocalyptic visions of a dried-up Valley vanishing.
We have three things that the Hohokam didnt, he saidpumping, storage (behind dams and underground), and recycling. When I mentioned this to Rusty Bowers, I couldnt remember the third thing, and he interjected: Prayer. I offered that the Hohokam had probably been praying for water too. I bet they were, Bowers said. And the Lord says, Okay. I could go Bing! But thats not how I work. Go out there and work, and well figure this thing out together.?
This famously libertarian place has a history of collective action on water. Thanks to the bipartisan efforts of the 20th centurythe federal dams built in the early 1900s; the 330-mile canal that brought Colorado River water to the Valley in the late 20th century; a 1980 law regulating development in Arizonas metro regions so theyd conserve groundwater, which cannot be replacedPhoenix has a lot of water. But two things have happened in this century: a once-in-a-millennium drought set in, and the political will to act collectively dried up. The legislature has become more and more partisan, Kathleen Ferris, an architect of the 1980 law, told me. And theres a whole lot of denial.
At some point, the civilization here stopped figuring this thing out together. The 1980 groundwater law, which required builders in regulated metro areas like the Valley to ensure a 100-year supply, left groundwater unregulated in small developments and across rural Arizona. In the mid-1990s, the legislature cut loopholes into the 100-year requirement. The God-given right to pursue happiness and wealth pushed housing farther out into the desert, beyond the reach of the Valleys municipal water systems, onto groundwater. In the unregulated rural hinterland, megafarms of out-of-state and foreign agribusinesses began to pump enormous quantities of groundwater. The water table around the state was sinking, and the Colorado River was drying up.
Ferris imagined a grim future. Without new regulation, she said, we will have land subsidence, roads cracking, destroying infrastructure, and in some cases peoples taps going dry. The crisis wouldnt hit the water-rich Phoenix metroplex first. Its going to be on the fringes, and all the people who allowed themselves to grow there are going to be really unhappy when they find out theres no water.
Most people in the Valley come from somewhere else, and John Hornewer came from Chicago. One summer in the early 1990s, when he was about 25, he went for a hike in the Hellsgate Wilderness, 75 miles northeast of Phoenix, and got lost. He ran out of water and couldnt find a stream. When he grew too weak to carry his backpack, he abandoned it. His eyes began to throb; every muscle hurt; even breathing hurt. He sank to his knees, his face hit the ground, and as the flies buzzed around he thought: Just stop my heart. He was saved by campers, who found him and drove him the 20 miles hed wandered from his car.
Almost dying from dehydration changed Hornewers life. I take water very seriously, he told me. Im passionate about water.
In the late 90s, Hornewer and his wife bought two and a half acres several miles up a dirt road in Rio Verde Foothills, a small community on the northeastern edge of the Valley. To the southwest, the city of Scottsdale ends and unincorporated Maricopa County starts where the golf courses give way to mesquite and the paved roads turn to dirt. Over the years, the desert around the Hornewers was filled in by people who wanted space and quiet and couldnt afford Scottsdale.
Seeing a need, Hornewer started a business hauling potable water, filling his 6,000-gallon trucks with metered water at a Scottsdale standpipe and selling it to people in Rio Verde with dry wells or none at all. What kept Rio Verde cheaper than Scottsdale was the lack of an assured water supply. Wildcat builders, exploiting a gap in the 1980 law, didnt tell buyers there wasnt one, or the buyers didnt ask. Meanwhile, the water table under Rio Verde was dropping. One of Hornewers neighbors hit water at 450 feet; another neighbor 150 feet away spent $60,000 on a 1,000-foot well that came up dry.
Hornewer wears his gray hair shoulder-length and has the face of a man trying to keep his inherent good nature from reaching its limit. In the past few years, he began to warn his Rio Verde customers that Scottsdales water would not always be there for them, because it came to Scottsdale by canal from the diminishing Colorado River. We got rain a couple of weeks agoeverythings good! his customers would say, not wanting to admit that climate change was causing a drought. He urged the community to form a water districta local government entity that would allow Rio Verde to bring in water from a basin west of the Valley. The idea was killed by a county supervisor who had done legal work for a giant Saudi farm that grew alfalfa on leased state land, and who pushed for EPCOR, the private Canadian utility, to service Rio Verde. The county kept issuing building permits, and the wildcatters kept putting up houses where there was no water. When the mayor of Scottsdale announced that, as o",,,

NEW DELHI, June 4: Preparing to take office for a record third consecutive term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday pledged to work with all states, regardless of the party in power, to build a developed India.
In his first speech after the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Modi laid out his vision for the third term saying it would be a tenure of big decisions and key emphasis would be on uprooting corruption.
The fight against corruption is becoming tougher by the day. Corruption is being shamelessly glorified for political interest. In our third term, NDA will focus a lot on rooting out corruption of all kinds, Modi said.
Modis speech did not refer to its reduced numbers in Parliament but focussed on the clean sweep victories in assembly elections as well as Lok Sabha wins in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
Modi also said that the Congress has been wiped out in several states and pointed out that the combined number of seats won by the opposition alliance was less than that of the BJP alone.
Modis victory speech at the BJP headquarters, however, was thin on politics and heavy on the future roadmap of his government, which he noted was coming for the third consecutive time, a first in six decades.
Our Constitution is our guiding light. I want to assure that the Centre will work with all states, irrespective of the party in power there, to work towards our resolve to make India a developed country, Modi said.
The prime minister arrived at the BJP headquarters to a rousing welcome by hundreds of supporters who chanted Modi, Modi. He was greeted by BJP President J P Nadda and Union Ministers Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah on the dais.
The backdrop on the stage had Dhanyawad Bharat written in various languages, including Urdu.
Modi began his speech with Jai Jagannath and thanked the people of Odisha for giving BJP a clear mandate for the first time.
He also thanked TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar  his NDA allies  for the electoral successes in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar. (PTI)

Poll strategist Prashant Kishor has scoffed at the Congress-led INDIA bloc's chances of defeating the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, arguing the opposition grouping had failed to capitalise - multiple times - when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government was on the defensive. He made specific mention of the contentious RamMandir (consecration in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya), saying, ""The opposition virtually lay down arms (after the event). By the time they woke up again, in February, it was too late.""
""By the time INDIA bloc came into action, it was too late... the BJP had already recovered space it lost,"" Mr Kishor, who orchestrated winning campaigns for three members of the opposition group - the Trinamool, the Congress, and the DMK - told NDTV on Tuesday.
Mr Kishor also criticised the INDIA bloc's failure to announce a common prime ministerial candidate - something the BJP has also pounced on - and suggested this told the voters the opposition group ""does not have a reliable face... or a strong narrative against the BJP"".

He also criticised the group for failing to act after it was formed in June last year.
The INDIA bloc declared then its purpose was to defeat the BJP in every election, including the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, but failed to find common ground in five state elections held in November. In fact, disagreements with Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party over six Madhya Pradesh seats made headlines.

The Congress was thumped by the BJP in Madhya Pradesh, after which Trinamool boss and Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Mr Yadav both criticised the larger party.
The Trinamool had its own seat-share problems with the Congress, which resulted in Ms Banerjee fighting this election on her own, and potentially splitting votes in the BJP's favour.
In recent days, however, she has stressed that she remains a part of the INDIA bloc.

Mr Kishor's warning to the opposition echoes that which he made in April.
He had then said the BJP will add significantly to its seats and vote share in the southern and eastern India, two regions where its hold is weak-to-non-existent, barring Karnataka. He also said the BJP and Mr Modi were not invincible, but the opposition lost three distinct and realistic chances to defeat the party.

The three chances he was referring to were the saffron party's indifferent state election results in 2015 and 2016. Over those two years the party lost multiple Assembly polls.
The opposition, Mr Kishor has long argued, should have pressed its advantage in those 24 months to derail what has since become a formidable election-winning machinery.
The second chance was post-demonetisation, when the BJP had a big win in 2017 to win Uttar Pradesh for the first time in over a decade but almost lost Gujarat (the PM's home state), which it has ruled since 1995. Mr Kishor said the Congress ""blundered"" in the 2019 election, in which it got just 52 seats.
READ |Prashant Kishor's Poll Prediction ""Ludicrous, BJP-Sponsored"": Congress
The final ""dropped catch"", as Mr Kishor put it, was a dip in the Prime Minister's approval ratings post the Covid pandemic, and the BJP's poor showing in the Bengal election. ""If you keep dropping catches, the batter will score a century, especially if he is a good batter,"" Mr Kishor had warned two months ago.
The seven-phase general election concludes on June 1, when Mr Modi's Varanasi seat will vote.
Results will be out on June 4.

The ?gap between the NDA and the INDIA alliance is so small?, just about 60 seats, that they can make a difference to which formation forms the next government. The Congress party has said that it will discuss the possibilities on Wednesday with its partners. So, as of today, the matter of who forms the next government is still open and its up to the President as to who she invites to form it.
The ?State that scripted the BJPs uninterrupted reign at the Centre for two terms brought the saffron party below the majority mark ?on Tuesday.

The ?TDP, which joined very late to the NDA alliance, emerged as a major player?, giving the alliance a much-needed booster shot. With the BJP falling short of the magic figure, the TDPs support turns crucial for the alliance to form the Government at the Centre. From just three in the 2019 elections, the alliance increased its tally to 21, pushing the YSRCP to just 4 (which won 22 in 2019).
The ?Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) target of achieving a hat-trick of clean sweeps in Gujarat came undone Tuesday?, after it conceded the Banaskantha Lok Sabha seat to its rival Congress.
For the first time since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, the BJP has lost a Lok Sabha seat in Gujarat, winning 25 of the 26 seats in the State. The saffron party had won all the 26 seats during the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections and had targeted to win all the 26 seats with a victory margin of 5 lakh votes.
The ?BJPs backed splits in Uddhav Thackerays Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawars NCP?, including the controversial seizure of their party names and election symbols, backfired spectacularly. Voter anger against turncoats, coupled with issues such as agrarian distress, inflation, and the lacklustre performance of sitting BJP alliance MPs, proved to be decisive factors in the BJPs downfall in Maharashtra.
?In a major setback to the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal?, the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress is set to increase its seats in the state to 29 in the fiercely-contested LoK Sabha elections.
Despite the prediction of most of the exit polls that the BJP would get more seats than the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state, the saffron party has bagged a lesser number of seats in the 2024 LS elections than 2019 elections.
With the BJP falling behind the majority mark and its poll pitch of 400 ke par, opposition ?INDIA bloc said on Tuesday that the 2024 Lok Sabha election mandate is against Prime Minister Narendra Modi ?and he should own up the political and moral responsibility and step aside from another stint in power.
Unlike the previous two general elections, ?a clear mandate has eluded the BJP this time and the party appears set to win 240 seats?, down 63 from the 303 it had won in 2019, and 33 short of a clear majority of 272 in the 543-member Lok Sabha.
The BJP will make up for the shortfall with Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (United), which looked set to win 12 seats in Bihar, and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), looking to bag 17 seats in Andhra Pradesh besides minor allies including the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, the Lok Janshakti Party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha, and the Jana Sena Party. Together, the NDA constituents come up to about 291 seats, 19 over the majority mark in the Lower House.

BJP all set to fall short of absolute majority **INDIA bloc makes big gains ** Exit polls predictions proved wrong
NEW DELHI, June 4: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on Tuesday poised to form the government for a third consecutive term notwithstanding crushing losses in three Hindi heartland states after a bitterly fought election that was projected as a referendum on his popularity.
The Bharatiya Janata Party, whose candidates had contested in the name of Modi, won or was ahead in 240 seats and will fall short of the 272 majority mark and need the support of allies in the party-led National Democratic Alliance(NDA) for government formation, a far cry from the 303 and 282 seats it had won in 2019 and 2014 respectively to have a majority on its own.
With support from BJPs key allies N Chandrababu Naidus TDP and Nitish Kumars JD(U), which were leading or winning 16 and 12 seats in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar respectively, and other alliance partners, the NDA appeared to be on course to bag around 290 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha. The TDP also swept the assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh dislodging Y S Jagan Mohan Reddys YSRCP.
Preparing to take office for a record equalling historic third term, Prime Minister Modi pledged to work with all states, regardless of the party in power, to build a developed India.
Indias first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had served three consecutive terms.
In his first speech after the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Modi laid out his vision for the third term saying it would be a tenure of big decisions and key emphasis would be on uprooting corruption.
It is the first time that 73-year-old Modi will be dependent on allies to be in the government since he came into politics.
The fight against corruption is becoming tougher by the day. Corruption is being shamelessly glorified for political interest. In our third term, NDA will focus a lot on rooting out corruption of all kinds, Modi said.
Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge termed the poll outcome as the victory of the people and that of democracy.
We had been saying that this battle is between public and ModiThis mandate is against Modi. This is his political and moral defeat. It is a big defeat for a person who sought votes in his own name. He has suffered a moral setback, Kharge told reporters at the AICC headquarters flanked by Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi after the good showing by the Congress.
The elections also highlighted the revival of the main opposition Congress party under Rahul Gandhi, and the unexpected role of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh  under Akhilesh Yadav  as a giant slayer.
The trends and results did not throw up a landslide victory the BJP-led NDA had hoped for and what was projected by the exit polls. More than 640 million votes are to be counted in the worlds largest democratic exercise.
The NDA was stirred into life mostly around elections in the last 10 years as the BJPs big majority and shrinking opposition in the Lok Sabha made its allies mostly redundant but this time around, allies will matter more than ever.
The Congress, which is part of the opposition INDIA alliance, was leading or winning 99 seats compared to 52 it won in 2019 eating into BJPs share in Rajasthan and Haryana. The INDIA bloc won or was ahead in over 200 seats.
As SP chief Akhilesh Yadav kept the INDIA bloc morale high in Uttar Pradesh, the Trinamool Congress, another key ally of the opposition alliance, was leading or winning in 29 seats in West Bengal, higher than its 22 in 2019. The BJP, which had 18 seats in the last Lok Sabha election, was ahead in 12 seats.
In UP, the BJP won or was ahead in 33 seats as against its tally of 62 in 2019 and the SPs numbers went up, largely attributed to three factors  consolidation of Muslim votes in favour of SP, smart seat sharing agreements with Congress to avoid splitting of non-BJP votes and widespread discontent with the BJP government over jobs and price rise. The SP was winning or leading in 37 of the 80 seats at stake.
Modi retained the Varanasi seat but with a reduced victory margin of nearly 1.53 lakh votes in Varanasi. In 2019, the margin was 4,79,505.
Rahul Gandhi, often lampooned by the BJP as Shehzada, won Wayanad(Kerala) and Rae Bareli(UP) seats by a huge margin of 3,64,422 votes and 3,90,030 votes respectively.
The campaigning for the elections, which were conducted from April 19 to June 1 in seven phases, was marked by divisive communal issues and excessive reliance on Modi for getting votes. The prime minister held more than 300 rallies, travelling tirelessly almost every day to multiple locations.
The results also blew away the BJP narrative that it will score big in the southern states this time. It, however, returned a tally of zero in Tamil Nadu, and lost seats in Karnataka.
The BJP did make inroads in Kerala, winning a seat for the first time in a state where the Congress and the Left are the major political force, and in Telangana where it won or was leading in 8 seats. Popular Malayalam actor Suresh Gopi won the Thrissur seat in Kerala to help the lotus bloom.
In Andhra Pradesh, BJP ally Telugu Desam Party won or was leading in 16 seatsand the BJP was ahead or winning in three.
The biggest setback for the BJP, which faced a stronger challenge from the opposition, however, was in the north where, besides UP, the BJP also faced lossesin Rajasthan and Haryana.
West Bengal also dealt the party a raw deal, although it more than made up for the losses in Odisha.
Madhya Pradesh went fully saffron with the BJP winning or leading in all 29 seats. In Gujarat, too, BJP was winning or leading in 25 of 26 seats.
The situation was not as decisive in other states.
In Bihar, the BJP was ahead in 12 and its partner JD-U in 13, a vote of confidence for its leader Nitish Kumar who swung from INDIA back to the NDA ahead of the elections. The RJD was poised to win four seats.
In Rajasthan, BJP was ahead only in 14 seats, against all 25 its alliance won last time. The Congress was ahead in eight.
Haryana also threw up a shock result for the BJP, where the party was leading only in five and the Congress in five. In 2019, the saffron party had bagged all 10.
It appeared that the election marked a return to regular politics, where voters were more concerned about bread and butter issues, especially in some Hindi heartland states where the opposition INDIA alliance managed to rally supporters around the issues of unemployment and price rise.
Maharashtra, with 48 Lok Sabha seats, saw the Shiv Sena split down the middle since the last election. The BJP, which won 23 seats five years ago, was down with leads in 11 seats, while its ally Shiv Sena could get seven.
On the other end of the spectrum, the Congress was ahead in 12 seats, up from one, and the Shiv Sena (UBT) in 19. The NCP Sharad Pawar faction could get seven seats, giving the INDIA alliance, forged together by the common dislike of the BJP, a possible 38 seats.
However, a silver lining was provided by Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Piyush Goyal who appeared on course to easy victories in Nagpur and Mumbai North respectively.
In Odisha, the BJP was doing spectacularly well, with leads in 19 out of 21 seats, while the ruling Biju Janata Dal was down to just one. It was also ahead in the Odisha assembly elections, leading in 76 out of 146 seats, a success show in the state it had never succeeded in capturing.
In Andhra Pradesh, the Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP was ahead in 16 seats of 25, the BJP in three and the YSRCP in four.
Trends for Karnataka showed potential gains for the Congress, with leads in nine seats, up from one last time. The BJP, which got 25 seats in 2019, was ahead in 17.
Tamil Nadu seemed to be scripting another story, not ceding any space to the saffron party. The ruling DMK was ahead in 22 and ally Congress in nine, a notch higher than their 2019 positions.(PTI)

 The mammoth exercise to count votes polled for the Lok Sabha seats in the 2024 elections will begin at 8 am on Tuesday.Trends and results will begin from 8 am today.
Results of the Assembly elections in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh were held simultaneously with voting for the 543-member Lok Sabha. Results of 175 Assembly constituencies in Andhra Pradesh and 147 Assembly constituencies in Odisha and results of bypolls in 25 Assembly constituencies will also be declared today.
Strict security has been put in place for the smooth conduct of counting of votes for over 8,000 candidates in this general elections.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will seek a third consecutive term in government, while the Congress-led opposition aims to unseat them.
Most exit polls have predicted a return of PM Modi to power, a development which will make him the first Prime Minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to secure a third successive term in power,
Meanwhile, a delegation of Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc leaders met with the Election Commission of India urging it to ensure that postal ballots are counted and their results declared before the outcome of the EVMs is announced.
Earlier, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar had said that a ""very robust system"" has been put in place. ""There are around 10.5 lakh booths. Each booth will have 14 tables. There are observers and micro-observers. Nearly, 70-80 lakh people are involved in the process,"" he said.
The national capital is all set to witness the battle. With tight security arrangements in place, Delhi is well-prepared to watch the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
Around 70 companies of the security forces will be deployed at all seven counting centres across the national capital as part of the elaborate security arrangements made by the Delhi Police for today.
Delhi traffic police issued a fresh advisory ahead of the counting of votes scheduled for Tuesday, listing key roads where traffic restrictions and diversions will start from 5 am onwards to ensure smooth vehicular movement.
Prime Minister Modi's hometown, Gujarat, is also preparing for the vote-counting day as security forces rehearse and perform drills for the effortless conduct of D-day. Exit polls have predicted the return of the BJP to power. Various exit polls have given the BJP more than 64 seats in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is poised for a hat-trick win in Lok Sabha polls with a massive majority. Exit polls were predicted on Saturday and indicated that the ruling party at the Centre would improve its performance in several states ruled by other parties.
A few exit polls predicted that the BJP-led NDA could reach the goal of ""400 paar"" stated by BJP leaders in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls. The exit polls predicted that the ruling BJP-led NDA is poised to improve its performance over its 2019 record when it won 352 seats.
Two polls predicted the BJP would also improve its numbers from the 303 seats it won in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
In the 2019 elections, NDA wrested 353 seats, of which the BJP won 303 alone. The Opposition's UPA got only 93 seats of which the Congress got 52.The Lok Sabha elections were conducted in seven phases- on April 19, April 26, May 7, May 13, May 20, May 25 and June 1.The counting trends and results, as per data entered by RO/ARO for AC/PC will be available on the ECI website as well as on the Voter Helpline App, both iOS and Android Mobile Apps, according to the ECI.
The Voter Helpline App can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or Apple Play Store. Users can use the available filter to find out the winning/leading or trailing candidate details, along with the constituency-wise or State-wise results from the Voter Helpline App.
The local display of the trends and results by the CEOs/ROs/DEOs may also be done through the Digital Display Panels, it said.

The results provided a reason to smile to many parties that constitute the mosaic of India's multi-party democracy. Narendra Modi described the outcome as the ""victory of the world's biggest democracy"", and it indeed is so. Apart from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), the Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF), the J&K Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and a few others, good fortune favoured most others this election.
The talk of a 'Congress-mukt Bharat', which had been the leitmotif of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since it ousted the former in 2014, is now moot given how Rahul Gandhi has pulled his party out of the depths of irrelevance and almost doubled its seat share. Though its tally of 99 did not touch the three-digit mark - a distinction claimed by the BJP alone since 2014 - the Congress's performance can still be seen as a major feat.
On the other hand, Narendra Modi and the BJP's pan-India dominance has been reaffirmed again. Falling short of a majority by 32 seats, the BJP is eyeing a third term as the ruling party. Its tally of 240 surpasses the INDIA bloc's combined seat share of 234. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), in turn, has won 291 seats, which provides it with a clear mandate for forming the government.In a way, the decade-long single-party dominance in the Lok Sabha will now be replaced by a coalition - the norm in Indian politics between 1991 and 2014. Modi's hat-trick thus does not equal Jawaharlal Nehru's unencumbered three wins between 1952 and 1962.

Modi himself, who has seen unfettered power since 2001, first as Gujarat's Chief Minister till 2014 and as Prime Minister after that, will have to adjust to the paradigm of 'coalition dharma' now. In 1998, Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) made Atal Behari Vajpayee yield the post of Lok Sabha Speaker. Apart from him, the BJP's other major ally, the Janata Dal (United)'s (JD-U) Nitish Kumar, is also known to be a hard bargainer. Both Naidu and Nitish had been Modi's contemporaries in their respective states when he was at the helm in Gujarat. Today, the two have emerged as kingmakers.

It's possible now that the INDIA bloc would try to wean away the BJP's allies. But given Naidu and Nitish's past experience with INDIA, that may not be easy. A lot will depend on the BJP's coalition management, and in that, a leaf from the Vajpayee era may be of help.
Read |Opinion: How Almost Everyone Missed The All-Too-Visible Signs In Uttar Pradesh
For the opposition, this marks a big resurgence with the Congress having reversed the bad luck of the last two elections. With 99 seats, its floor leader in the Lok Sabha will now be recognised as a legitimate Leader of Opposition (a party needs 10% seats to be so recognised, but 44 seats in 2014 and 52 in 2019 deprived the Congress of this privilege).
Meanwhile, allegations of 'rigging' and the aspersions cast on the integrity of the Election Commission seem to have faded into obscurity. On January 25, when asked by this writer how the Congress could possibly have won the assembly polls in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana if the EVMs were indeed rigged, Sam Pitroda, the Congress's overseas chief and a tech czar according to many, had patronisingly brushed the query aside. Petitions were moved in the Supreme Court questioning the credibility of EVMs and VVPATs (Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail). The apex court, however, did not indulge the petitioners, who among other things advocated going back to paper ballots, citing examples from abroad.
The first post-poll meeting convened by the INDIA bloc on June 1 did not discuss an alternate plan of governance, even as the participants exuded confidence that Modi would be defeated. Instead, they asked the ECI to count the postal ballots before opening the EVMs, which, the poll body quickly pointed out, was already the norm.
Their appeals rebuffed by the apex court, the Opposition then made a last-minute attempt to discredit the world's largest-functioning election machinery, which since 1952 has acted as a beacon for electoral management the world over. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh alleged on the eve of counting that officials in seven states had been 'pressured' by the ruling regime. Union Home Minister Amit Shah was alleged to have telephoned '150 District Magistrates' to instruct them about 'managing' the poll verdict. Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, taking immediate cognisance, asked Ramesh to furnish details on June 3 itself, so that corrective action could be taken before counting began. But Ramesh sought a week's time to furnish these details.
The results on June 4 disproved all the naysaying. Congress and its allies got a fair share of the booty. While the BJP fell short of a majority in the Lok Sabha, it won the Vidhan Sabha polls in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha with its allies. In Odisha, the 25-year hegemony of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) drew to an end. The Congress drew a blank in Andhra Pradesh and Sikkim, finished third with merely 10% of seats in Odisha, and won a single seat in Arunachal Pradesh (where it anyway had not fielded candidates for 41 of the 60 seats).
The Samajwadi Party's (SP) resurgence in Uttar Pradesh, where it won more seats than the BJP, was remarkable. The Congress rode on its coattails and won six seats (the party has just two seats in the state assembly). The SP's Akhilesh Yadav harped on his Pichhda-Dalit-Alpsankhyak, or the PDA, formula; INDIA was rarely referred to. In neighbouring Bihar, though the Rashtriya Janata Dal's (RJD) Tejashwi Yadav emerged as an energetic campaigner, his party could not benefit from its INDIA bloc membership.
In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress has held its ground, while the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena and the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Maharashtra have registered a sound resurrection after seeing deep splits and losing their symbols to rebel factions: Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar-led NCP.
The truncated tally of the BJP can also be attributed to the erosion of its relations with erstwhile allies Shiv Sena and SAD. In Rajasthan, the sidelining of Vasundhara Raje may have enabled the Congress to stall the BJP's sweep. The BJP must thus introspect on its inter- and intra-party management as it reviews the 2024 verdict.
On the other hand though, by winning a seat in Kerala, the BJP has expanded its presence in the South. This, combined with the victory in Odisha, pushes the party's pan-India footprint.
However, the BJP's loss in Faizabad - of which Ayodhya is a part - and the scraping win in Meerut of the telly ""Ram"", Arun Govil, point to a possible waning of Hindutva's appeal.
Results in three seats in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir are also of concern.
While Rahul Gandhi rejoices in his party's upsurge, the son of Indira Gandhi's assassin, Sarabjit Khalsa, has been elected as an Independent from the Congress-dominated Faridkot seat in Punjab. Another Punjab seat, Khadoor Sahab, has returned Amritpal Singh as the winner; he is currently lodged in Assam's Dibrugarh for his separatist activities.
In Jammu & Kashmir's Baramulla, Abdul Rasheed, better known as 'Engineer Rasheed' and currently in Delhi's Tihar jail over terrorism funding charges, has defeated former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah as well as Sajjad Lone, son of yet another Kashmir stalwart. The unprecedentedly high voter turnout in Jammu & Kashmir is a good indicator. But the victories of these three Independents in sensitive border states do not bode well for India's democracy.

Asian shares retreated Tuesday, on signs of weakness in the US economy, even as the data boosted hopes for an interest rate cut, while Indian markets dived as it appeared Indias prime minister would not win as big an election victory as expected. European stocks slipped, led by a fall in energy stocks (due to crude oil price weakness) while investors refrained from placing huge bets before the European Central Banks interest rate decision later this week.
Nifty crashed on June 04 as vote count suggested weaker than expected performance by the NDA. Nifty fell with a large bear candle that engulfed the candles of the last 3 weeks, after filling the upgap made on the previous day. While clarity on the final outcome and formation of the new Govt could take some more time, Nifty could vacillate between 21710 to 22417 in the near term.
Manish Jain, Director - Institutional Business (Equity & FI) Division at Mirae Asset Capital Markets:
Investors like certainty and continuation of policies. India is a long term structural growth story. A lot of elements are in place. Over anything the economics should prevail. We are already in top in factors like GDP, market cap, demographic dividend etc. It will be an endeavour for all the policy makers to take the country to further heights. I dont think any derailment on these efforts is in anybodys interest. As a country we have seen many regime changes. Businesses and markets have weathered all of it and good businesses have always rewarded the investors. If valuations get more reasonable from here on because of some factors, more the reason to invest in India.
Yashovardhan Khemka, Senior Manager, Research & Analytics at Abans Holdings Ltd:
The Election results are showing a less than halfway mark for the current BJP government, Pointing towards a coalition government. This will lead to dependence on allies in making key policy decision, and sharing certain cabinet seats, which will lead to policy paralysis and uncertainty in the governments functioning.
The markets, are pricing the risk associated with this scenario, and the potential impact of shift toward socialistic policies by the government, thus leading to sell-off in the market
Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research, StoxBox, said Markets have reacted sharply to the initial trends of the NDA leading on around 290 seats which look way behind the exit polls which were projecting around 350-370 seats. With the NDA still looking to form a government, though with the important support of coalition partners, markets look jittery about the prospects of strong decision making. Markets believe that the reformistic approach, which was a hallmark of the previous two terms, might take a backseat in the third term. However, our sense is that it is still early to jump to conclusions and should ideally wait for a clearer picture.
The rupee tumbled 45 paise to close at 83.59 (provisional) against the US dollar on Tuesday as the ruling BJP is unlikely to muster an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha elections.
Colin Shah, MD, Kama Jewelry on Election Results and Its Impact On Gems & Jewellery Sector:

As the election results have not aligned with the expectations set by the exit polls, it is evident that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will not be able to form the government without the support of coalition partners. We anticipate an increase in market volatility in the near term. Due to the dependency on coalition partners, the upcoming National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government may shift its focus towards a welfare-oriented approach rather than concentrating on reforms during the July Interim Budget. However, our long-term view remains bullish on Indias story. The expected continuation of existing policies and the strong fundamentals of the Indian economy support the sustainability of long-term growth and valuations for Indian corporations. It is anticipated that if the incumbent party forms the government with narrow margins, it could potentially impact the pace and implementation of policies, leading to a healthy correction in the markets in the near term.

The steep fall is due to the results so far falling short of the exit polls which the market had discounted yesterday.

Also it is possible that Modi 3.0 may not be as reform-oriented as the market expected and may turn more welfare- oriented. This is getting reflected in the strength in FMCG stocks.

Contrary to expectations, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty opened negative on Tuesday. Sensex was at 75,346.45, down -1122.33 or 1.47 per cent lower.Nifty was at 22,935.25, down 328.65 points (-1.41%)
With the 733 point rally in the Nifty yesterday the market has already discounted a clear win for the NDA and majority on its own for BJP. Only a dramatic change from this expected outcome will cause a major change in the market.
Investors need not rush in to buy today even if the results confirm the exit polls. Remain invested in largecaps and do some profit booking in smallcaps.
A significant trend yesterday was the largecaps outperforming smallcaps. This is primarily the consequence of FIIs turning buyers. If the FIIs continue to buy, this largecap outperformance will continue. RIL, L&T, HDFC, ICICI and M&M are on strong wickets.

GBP: Sterling has breached the 1.28 mark. It is up about 60 pips from yesterdays levels at 1.2810
AUD: Aussie is up about 25 pips at 0.6685. It has not gained as much as risk sentiment has deteriorated a bit.

Brent has come off to USD 78.1 per barrel as lower than expected ISM Mfg has dampened growth outlook. Gold has risen to USD 2350 per ounce.
Domestic Developments
Today is the counting day. Most exit polls are indicating a convincing majority for NDA. The new anchor for the number of seats NDA would get is 350 we believe. If there is any major departure in either direction from that number, we may see the domestic asset classes react. One also needs to be prepared for intraday volatility as initial results may not be representative of the final results depending on which seats trends are revealed first
Equities
Nifty rallied 3.25% on exit polls to end at 23263, a new all time high. VIX collapsed to 21 from around 24 levels. Infra, Realty and energy stocks outperformed. Among thematics, PSU stocks and Adani group stocks outperformed. GIFT is indicating a gain of 1% for Nifty at open
Bonds and Rates
Yield on the benchmark 10y dropped 4bps to 6.94% as the market expects fiscal consolidation to continue if the NDA gets a third term. We may a further rally in domestic bonds on lower crude prices and lower US treasury yields, if election results do not throw any surprises.
USD/INR
Rupee strengthened 32p to 83.15. It has momentarily breached the 83 mark to trade at 82.95 but gave up gains to subsequently.
FPI and FDI flows which are on the sidelines, waiting for election uncertainty to get out of the way will gradually start pouring in. These would be beside the bond index inclusion related flows. RBI would mostly absorb the inflows and put a firm floor under the USD/INR pair to ensure competitiveness with peer basket, especially Yuan. If the Dollar weakens overall, we may see the RBI become a bit tolerant of Rupee appreciation.
Rupee is likely to open around 83.10 and trade a 82.80-83.20 range with appreciation bias.
3m ATMF implied vols had ended 24bps lower at 2.66%. 1y forward yield ended 3bps lower at 1.63%

The Nifty surged yesterday, fuelled by strong exit poll results predicting a decisive victory for the BJP-led NDA and positive economic indicators like an 8.2% GDP growth in FY24, an above normal monsoon forecast, a 10% rise in GST collections, and falling oil prices. Today, with Lok Sabha election results pending, markets are keenly watching for a potential historic third term for PM Narendra Modi and whether the NDA will exceed 400 seats. A favourable outcome could drive Nifty towards the 24000 mark, while the 22500 level remains crucial support. Key stocks to watch include HDFC AMC, SUZLON, and DLF, with SUZLON recommended for long-term accumulation.

Jyotiraditya Scindia's induction into the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led council of ministers has cemented his importance in the BJP setup since he quit the Congress four years ago, marking the beginning of his second stint in the cabinet as a saffron party leader.
In the 2024 general elections, Scindia, 53, secured a landslide victory from his traditional Guna seat, contesting as a BJP candidate for the first time, with a record margin of over 5 lakh votes.
The BJP has won all 29 constituencies in Madhya Pradesh, also wresting the Chhindwara seat, the last stronghold of Congress from the Kamal Nath family, which it had failed to win in 2019.
On Sunday, Scindia was sworn in as a Cabinet minister in the Narendra Modi 3.0 government.
In 2020, Scindia was first inducted as Union minister in the Modi government and assigned Civil Aviation portfolio after he helped the BJP topple the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh.
Scindia's ministerial appointment comes as a recognition of his notable performance as the Civil Aviation and Steel Minister, according to sources close to him.
He won the Guna seat by a margin of 5,40,929 votes, defeating Congress's Yadvendra Rao Deshraj Singh. This victory holds personal significance as he lost his mother, the late Rajmata Madhviraje Scindia, shortly after the polling.
Though Scindia was a Rajya Sabha member from the BJP, he contested from Guna for the first time as a saffron party candidate in his political career. Despite being a Rajya Sabha member of the BJP, this was Scindia's first Lok Sabha contest as a BJP candidate.
He faced a significant setback in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, losing to his former aide KP Yadav of the BJP. Subsequently, Scindia joined the BJP in March 2020, citing differences with the Congress leadership.
Scindia's political lineage runs deep, with his family having represented Guna for generations.
His grandmother, the late Vijayaraje Scindia, and his father, the late Madhavrao Scindia, previously held the seat.
Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia was one of the founding members of the Jana Sangh.
Born on January 1, 1971, and educated at Harvard and Stanford, Scindia entered politics after his father's sudden death in a plane crash, winning a bypoll in 2002. He went on to clinch victories in general elections in 2004, 2009 and 2014 from Guna as a Congress leader.
He served in the then Congress-led UPA government from 2007 to 2014, holding positions as Minister of State for Communications, Commerce and Industry, and Power.
Although re-elected from Guna in 2014, he lost the seat in 2019. As the chairman of the Congress campaign committee in the 2018 Madhya Pradesh assembly polls, he played a crucial role in the party's victory, although the Chief Ministership went to Kamal Nath.
Scindia's discontent with the Congress leadership culminated in his switch to the BJP in 2020. A key turning point came when 22 Congress MLAs loyal to Scindia, including six ministers, resigned, dislodging the Congress government from power in his home state.
Chief Minister Chouhan had noted that the entire Scindia family was now united under the BJP banner.
Scindia's familial ties to royalty include his mother from Nepal's royal family and his wife from Baroda's royal Gaekwad family. PM Modi had referred to Scindia as the ""son-in-law of Gujarat."" Scindias responsibility and role in the BJPs plans were clear from the onset of the campaigning during the 2023 assembly elections.
The first test under the BJP for the Maharaja of Gwalior was on his home turf, the Gwalior-Chambal region, which comprised 34 seats. He delivered 18 to the BJP, up from seven in 2018.
The result cemented Scindias importance in the BJP set-up, where he is seen as someone who enjoys the confidence of PM Modi and Amit Shah.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'NDTV News'}",,Analysis: Chandrababu Naidu Makes A Spectacular Comeback After Jail,Never write off any politician. That is the biggest lesson from the Andhra Pradesh election.,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/analysis-chandrababu-naidu-makes-a-spectacular-comeback-after-jail-5814320,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-03/igpi2sac_chandrababu-naidu-pti-_625x300_22_March_19.jpg,2024-06-04T08:56:49Z,"Chandrababu Naidu has scripted a remarkable comeback.
Never write off a politician. That is the biggest lesson from the Andhra Pradesh election.
Less than eight months ago, when Chandrababu Naidu went to jail, it looked like the 74-year-old politician and his Telugu Desam Party (TDP) were down and out.
Prospects were looking bleak for the ageing senior politician when he was sent to jail for 52 days as an accused with multiple cases against him, enough to keep him incarcerated for long.

At the time, the ruling YSR Congress Party and Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy were apparently riding high on the back of welfare schemes, and seemed to be almost invincible.
The efforts of Naidu, his son Lokesh and wife Bhuvaneswari to convert the incarceration into sympathy votes for the TDP, did not seem to draw any support or visible crescendo of protests.
For Chandrababu Naidu, a defeat in 2024 could have meant curtains for his 50-year political career. However, the wily politician, as he is often described, has managed a more-than-convincing comeback, once again in an alliance with the BJP, even though he was cold-shouldered multiple times.
The turning point was almost cinematic - when action hero Pawan Kalyan emerged from Rajahmundry Central Jail after meeting Chandrababu Naidu and declared, dramatically, that he and the Jana Sena would fight the elections with Chandrababu Naidu and defeat Jagan Mohan Reddy's YSRCP. It was as though the ""power star"", as fans refer to him, had thrown a lifeline to the TDP leader.
You could argue that it was a compulsion for Pawan Kalyan too to stay afloat politically. He had the option of waiting it out, allowing the TDP to be subsumed and using the political vacuum to grow, with the backing of the BJP. But Pawan Kalyan knew well that Naidu was not a hot favourite among BJP leaders in Delhi, given his sharp criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, not once but twice. The first instance was in 2002, when he demanded Narendra Modi's resignation as Gujarat chief minister after the post-Godhra riots of 2002. The second time was in 2018, when he quit the NDA blaming Modi for not granting special category status to Andhra Pradesh, which would have brought it more funds.
It was Pawan Kalyan's persistent efforts that made it possible for Chandrababu Naidu to once again find a place in the NDA, and stand alongside Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. Pawan Kalyan has admitted that it came at the cost of seats that his own party had to sacrifice.
Alliance done, Chandrababu Naidu knew the biggest challenge would be for the chemistry of the alliance to translate into the transfer of votes between the two parties. Something sorely needed by the BJP, which had less than one per cent vote share in Andhra Pradesh.
Naidu and Pawan Kalyan both worked towards conveying to their cadre and the people that they intended to make the alliance work. They held multiple joint meetings every single week, sharing the dais, working up a healthy chemistry on stage, showing they respected and valued each other mutually, and ironing out any differences backstage.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders too reinforced the TDP-Jana Sena's narrative of development and progress as opposed to a ""corrupt and inefficient"" ruling party in Andhra. This, even though Jagan's YSRCP had been a handy friend-in-need to the BJP at the Centre.
Naidu did not want to take chances. So, his manifesto promised the YSRCP's welfare programmes and more, to provide jobs and address aspirations. From both sides, there were personal attacks, character assassination, below-the-belt jibes. With an election and a state at stake, each side seemed to think it was fair game.
On World Bicycle Day just a couple of days ago, Chandrababu Naidu had posted his advice to people to get on the bicycle, calling it the best exercise they could get. The people of Andhra Pradesh are definitely buying it.
Interestingly, Chandrababu Naidu started his political career with the Congress, even supporting Sanjay Gandhi during the Emergency of 1975-77 as an Indian Youth Congress leader. He became the youngest MLA at 28 and a minister in the T Anjaiah-led Congress cabinet in 1980.
Naidu's marriage to NT Rama Rao's daughter Bhuvaneswari brought him to the Telugu Desam Party. He earned his father-in-law's confidence by helping him defeat a coup by Nadendla Bhaskar Rao in August 1984. Eleven years later though, Chandrababu Naidu himself orchestrated a coup against his father-in-law NTR, and took over the reins of the party.
At 45, he became Chief Minister and served two terms until 2004. In that period, Chandrababu Naidu built Brand Naidu as an economic reformer-politician. He put Brand Hyderabad on the world IT map and even earned the moniker of CEO of Andhra Pradesh for leveraging technology to streamline administration and governance.
Naidu's role in national politics was first as convenor of the United Front headed by HD Deve Gowda, and later IK Gujral. In 1999, the TDP emerged as the second largest party in NDA, with 29 MPs.
Naidu was back as chief minister again, after 10 years, with Andhra Pradesh now bifurcated, and people quite heartbroken to lose the capital Hyderabad. When he realised he may not win in 2014 without the support of the BJP and Pawan Kalyan, he reached out to both of them to make it happen.
In 2018, however, after once again splitting with the BJP, Chandrababu Naidu faced a humiliating defeat in 2019, winning just 23 assembly and three Lok Sabha seats -- the party's worst showing ever.
But Chandrababu Naidu has scripted a remarkable comeback, using his political sagacity and resilience to overcome all odds.
PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com
The election results have once again presented an opportunity to Chandrababu Naidu to play kingmaker, like he did as United Front Convenor. Some say, this could be his best chance to negotiate and even become PM. But those close to him say, he is not going to do that.
Naidu has often been called a political opportunist, and does not really inspire confidence in allies, given his gambles in striking alliances and friendships. This is Naidu's chance to prove he can be a reliable ally.

Defying all exit-poll predictions, the TMC raced ahead in 29 of West Bengals 42 Lok Sabha seats, surprising political pundits, while the BJP struggled to reach double digits, leading in only 12 seats, and Congress won just one seat, according to the EC website.
If TMCs leads translate into results, the party is set for its second-best performance in the state, following its 2014 victory when it won 34 seats.
As of 6 pm, the TMC had secured 46 per cent of the votes, up from 43 per cent in 2019.
In the last Lok Sabha polls, the TMC won 22 seats, the BJP 18, and the Congress two. Despite a vigorous campaign led by top BJP leaders, the party is poised to see a decline of seven seats, and a 2 per cent drop in vote share, having received 40 per cent of the votes in 2019.

BY Raghavendra with a margin of 243715, JDS Kumaraswamy with a margin of 284620 votes, and Mallesh Babu with a margin of 71388 voters.
From a brutal majority to a virtual battle for survival. YS Jagan Mohan Reddys electoral fortunes seem to have plummeted to unexpected depths within a span of five years, during which the outgoing Chief Minister launched a slew of populist measures.
Having floated his YSRCP in 2011 following the death of his father and charismatic late Chief Minister of the undivided Andhra Pradesh, YS Rajasekhar Reddy, Reddy had to wait for another eight years before getting into the ruling saddle.
We went to the Election Commission at short notice to convey a concern of ours. The main issue was about not updating parliamentary constituency data round by round in terms of votes counted and the results of that round. However, it was clarified that it is done Assembly segment-wise. Parliamentary constituencies have on average seven Assemblies and it is done each round in each Assembly segment. Different Assembly segments follow different speeds of counting and also updation which is why there is a lack of synchronism in parliamentary constituency on the whole.

Indias dominance in cricket has made the IPL and upcoming World Cup central to the sport. However, as cricket grows, so does potential political interference.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma during the India vs Australia 4th Test match at Narendra Modi Stadium at Ahmedabad, in Gujarat on March 09, 2023.
In early May, amid the simmering heat of Indias general elections and record-breaking summer temperatures across the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi leveraged one of Indias great loves with what many say is one of his worst instincts. Modi used Indias love of cricket to bait communal tensions along religious lines for political gain.
This time, the cocktail of discontent was delivered on a cricket field in Dhar, a city in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. Modi spun a story that claimed the major opposition party, the Indian National Congress, if voted in to power, would decide the composition of the national cricket team on the basis of religion. Modis perceived dog-whistle pandered to the rampant Islamophobia that is carefully nurtured among his voters as seen in recent attacks across India.
The people of Madhya Pradesh had already witnessed the Congress Party promise an Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise for the state last year during the campaign in the local assembly election.
Cricket tends to go cap-in-hand with politics in India, and recent events point to yet another new entanglement.
Ahead of the 2024 election, the Indian Supreme Court ended the electoral bonds funding scheme. This allowed individuals and businesses to donate to political parties anonymously and without limit. In scrapping the scheme, the required disclosures brought to light the curious case of Chennai Super Kings Cricket Ltd (CSK), the owner of the Chennai-based IPL franchise.
The Kings are five-time champions of the IPL and home to one of Indian crickets favorite sons, M.S Dhoni, alongside a host of international stars over the years. In April 2019, CSK donated around $600,000 to the political party All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which was part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for the 2019 general election.
Its yet another reminder in India is that where politics goes, so will cricket.
From its colonial origins to modern times, Indian cricket has carried the influence and power that politicians crave. It is not unusual to see political leaders take over the running of the game in India, whether it is through a direct role at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or through proxy figures.
However, the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a supreme force in Indian politics provoked a stronger imbalance in the relationship between the executive and the autonomous institutions that are supposed to offer checks and balances in a democratic society. A tendency to declaw opposition and establish unquestionable control marked this shift, which seeped into all corners of Indias cultural life. This change can be seen in the promotion of a Hindu nationalist agenda in Hindi cinema.
Cricket, with its immense cultural hold on the Indian public, was always ripe ground for an institutional takeover that could be hitched to the Hindu nationalist agenda. Three major trends encapsulate the ongoing phase in the relationship between Indian cricket and politics.
First, there has been a nepotistic drive to appoint family and friends in positions of power across the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the state bodies. For instance, BCCI Secretary Jay Shah is the son of the minister for Home Affairs, Modis trusted lieutenant Amit Shah.
Second, we have seen the promotion of cricket as a site for national and cultural contestation through jingoistic messaging, and the aligning of Indian teams fortunes with narratives of New India.

And, finally, cricket history has been reconstructed by renaming stadiums and the shift of the power center to Gujarat, Modis home state.
It is a measure of Indias control over international cricket that Jay Shah is also the head of the Asian Cricket Council. The sports minister in the Modi government, Anurag Thakur, was the president of the BCCI between 2016-17 while his younger brother Arun Dhumal is the current chairman of the IPL, which dominates the global cricketing calendar and coffers.
T20 franchise cricket in India is a welcoming home to the friends of the Modi regime.
One of the major capitalist allies of the BJP, the Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance group, owns a team in the IPL (Mumbai Indians) while Adani Sportsline, part of the Adani conglomerate, successfully bid for the Gujarat Giants in the Womens Premier League (WPL).
A recent report by journalist Sharda Ugra for the 2024 Wisden Almanack revealed that the BCCI had failed in its attempt to force a switch of kit colors for Indias match against Pakistan in Ahmedabad at last years 50-over World Cup. Instead of the usual blue, it was suggested an orange kit should be worn for that match.
Orange was said to be chosen since it has come to be identified as the color of Hindutva (Hindu nationalism). The color, used interchangeably with saffron (bhagwa), is sported by BJP party workers and Hindutva followers  its appeal is enhanced in their eyes due to its historical connection with Brahminical priests and temples.
Despite the kit change failure, the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad did not lack nationalist tension that day. From the DJ blaring Hindutva Pop tunes to the heckling of the plucky, aggressive Pakistani cricketer Mohammad Rizwan by Indian fans with a Hindu nationalist chant, the India-Pakistan match cemented the multitude of ways in which Indian cricket is now influenced by the cultural politics of Hindu nationalism.
The westward power shift in Indian cricket is also on.Historically, Mumbai enjoyed an outsized influence over the sport, but its supremacy was never hitched to a certain political formation. The rise of the Gujarat bloc in Indian politics is epitomized by the BJPs Modi-Shah combo.Cricket in Gujarat has been a huge beneficiary of their largesse since the state mens side has won the domestic cricket tournament in each format of the game over the past decade.
Ahmedabad has become the de facto home of Indian cricket. As the biggest cricket arena in the world with a capacity of 132,000, the Narendra Modi Stadium hosted the opening and the final match of the 2023 ODI World Cup, not to forget the marquee India-Pakistan match.
It has also hosted a welcome event for then-President of the United States Donald Trump, while Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was driven around the stadium ahead of the first test between India and Australia in 2023.
The renaming of the stadium after Modi was unusual since most venues in India take their name from politicians or rich patrons after they die.
The drive to reshape cricket venues is not limited to Gujarat, as the stadium in Delhi was also renamed after former finance minister (and Delhi District Cricket Association chief) Arun Jaitley in 2019, not long after he died. This tendency to claim cricket venues under the name of BJP politicians is symptomatic of a wider trend that has seen the Modi regime take an obsessive interest in renaming roads and other sites that bear Islamic names with Hindu nationalist icons.
Irrespective of how the election results turn out on June 4, Indian cricket will bear the scars of the Hindu nationalist regime for some time to come.

"{'id': None, 'name': 'The Diplomat'}",Kavita Chowdhury,Modi Wins a Third Term But the Opposition INDIA Bloc Cuts Incumbent BJP Down to Size,"In a telling blow, the BJP even lost in the constituency that includes the Ram Temple, in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh.",https://thediplomat.com/2024/06/modi-wins-a-third-term-but-the-opposition-india-bloc-cuts-incumbent-bjp-down-to-size/,https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2024-06-04-181832.jpg,2024-06-04T18:13:00Z,"Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific
In a telling blow, the BJP even lost in the constituency that includes the Ram Temple, in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is greeted by supporters as he arrives at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters in New Delhi, India, June 4, 2024.
In one of the most closely contested elections in recent times, the opposition INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) coalition made a remarkable debut, bagging 234 seats even as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi managed to scrape through to a third term in office. His party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won 240 seats and along with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) allies managed to cross the 272 majority mark. Indias lower house has 543 seats in total.
In 2019, the BJP had won a brute majority of 303 seats on its own.
The BJP-led NDA got 45 percent of the vote while the Congress and its INDIA alliance got 42 percent.
The biggest upset for the Hindu nationalist BJP came in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) where the INDIA parties outstripped the BJP to bag 43 seats. The BJP had been brimming with confidence before the polls, even bragging that it would secure a 400-seat victory this time, especially after fulfilling its promise of building the historic Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. However the BJP got a rude jolt when its candidate, Lallu Singh, lost in the Ram Mandir constituency, Faizabad.
The INDIA parties contesting in UP  the Samajwadi Party and the Congress, with young leaders Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi, respectively  trounced the BJP in a state where it won 62 out of the 80 seats in the last election, accounting for one-fifth of its 300-plus majority. This time, the BJP managed just 33 seats in UP, nearly halving its 2019 result.
The 2024 results, according to reputed pollster Prannoy Roy, formerly of NDTV television and now on the online news platform deKoder, are a huge mandate against one mans dictatorship. The opposition alliance fought the polls on the plank of saving the Constitution and preventing the country from sliding into dictatorship.
The results demonstrate a remarkable turnaround for the Grand Old Party, the Congress, which had been decimated in the past decade. It won a paltry 52 seats in the 2019 elections and just 44 in 2014, when Modi decisively trounced the Congress-led UPA and came to power. In the 2024 polls, a resurgent Congress nearly doubled its numbers to 99 seats, which is being largely attributed to the efforts of its leader, Rahul Gandhi.
The two long marches that the Gandhi scion undertook, from Kashmir in the north to Kanyakumari, the southern tip of India, and again from western India to the remote northeast in Manipur, helped to revive the fortunes of the party. Gandhi himself won both seats that he contested, in north and south India, by record margins. In Rae Bareli, in UP, formerly his mother Sonia Gandhis constituency, he won by over 300,000 votes while in Wayanad Kerala he also won a landslide victory.
The pro-Congress mood in UP was best reflected in Amethi, another Gandhi family bastion, where a long-time Congress party worker, Kishori Lal Sharma, managed to unseat a sitting union minister of the BJP, Smriti Irani.
After the results, Gandhi said the Congress manifesto had quite accurately raised issues close to the peoples hearts, such as unemployment and inflation, which was reflected in the verdict.
Beyond UP, Modi has been humbled in the eastern state of West Bengal. Modi himself visited the state 20 times during the campaign, hoping to increase the BJP tally from the 18 seats it won last time. However the Trinamool Congress (TMC) under the countrys only woman chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, convincingly stamped out the BJP challenge, winning 29 of the 42 seats in the state. The BJPs count was reduced to 12.
Former TMC member of Parliament Mahua Moitra, who had been specifically targeted for being outspoken against Modi and his crony capitalist friends and was subsequently suspended from Parliament, won a landslide victory from her Krishnananagr constituency. Moitra told The Diplomat during the campaign, The people are the final arbiters in a democracy. This time I will win by a larger margin.
For the BJP, while UP proved to be disappointing, states like Bihar in the east spelled good news for the saffron party. Together with its allies, the regional party Janata Dal (United) of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the Lok Janshakti Party, and the Hindustani Awam Morcha, the NDA coalition managed to hold on to the state, winning 30 of the 40 seats in Bihar. INDIA alliance partners Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress were limited to just seven seats, belying the huge turnout of people during their rallies in the two-month long election campaign.
Another state that has helped to keep the BJP afloat is the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, where its NDA ally, the regional Telugu Desam Party TDP, has won 16 of 25 seats, routing the incumbent YSR Congress. Former Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu of the TDP can now leverage some power in the NDA alliance, since his party will help to prop up the BJP government in Delhi. Likewise, Nitish Kumar of the JD(U) in Bihar, another NDA ally who deserted the INDIA group right at the cusp of the 2024 polls, will now have a sizable say in the BJP-led NDA coalition.
Modi had put in great efforts for his BJP to breach the southern states in India. The BJP can take heart from the fact that it has opened its account in Kerala, which has a history of fiercely shunning the BJPs Hindutva or Hindu supremacy ideology. It capitalized on a growing Islamophobia and divisions within the Christian church to bag the Thrissur seat in the state.
In the southern state of Tamil Nadu, however, the BJP once again failed to make a mark. The regional DMK party and the Congress made huge gains and consolidated their position, together winning 31 of the 39 seats in the state (22 for the DMK and nine for the Congress).
Significantly, the BJP had made a clean sweep in 2019 of the northern states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand; it also won all the seats in the BJP-ruled states of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. This time around, it managed to rout the Congress once again in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand.
However, the Congress has put up a strong fight in Rajasthan, where it gained eight seats, and managed to even win one seat in the state of Gujarat, Modis home province. In the south, in Karnataka, which swore in a strong Congress-led state government last year, the Congress won nine seats to the BJPs 17. For context, in 2019, the BJP had won 25 of the 29 seats in the state. In the northern state of Haryana, Congress has clawed back, winning five of the 10 seats in the state. It was zero last time around.
Political analyst Yogendra Yadav hailed the verdict as a victory of the people, the public.
The ruling BJP had captured all institutions like the Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation, and deployed them against opposition leaders at will. The Election Commission (EC) was a partisan player, turning a blind eye to the transgressions by the BJP and violations of the Model Code of Conduct MCC. The unfair playing field in these elections had even been commented upon internationally.
Yet, Yadav argued, despite the Modi governments jailing political opponents, freezing bank accounts of the Congress party and others, and controlling all major media networks, it could not bag a brute majority. Irrespective of the fact that Modi will continue to be prime minister, Yadav said, the will of the people prevailed and the BJP has been cut down to size.
Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said the poll verdict is a resounding mandate against Modi. Modi had repeatedly resorted to polarizing the electorate, including hate speech against minority Muslims. He had targeted the Congress, alleging that they fraternized with Muslims, ate mutton, and would target devout Hindu women and seize their jewelry (mangal sutra). 
What has come as a rude shock for the INDIA bloc, however, is the verdict in Delhi. After the arrest of chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal, the opposition alliance was hoping to benefit from the sympathy factor. The AAP, despite holding resounding majorities in the Delhi Legislative Assembly since 2015, has never won a parliamentary seat from Delhi, with the BJP winning all seven seats in parliament in the 2014 and 2019 general elections. The Congress, much to the anger of several of its own leaders, allied with the AAP, but the alliance failed to register any wins in the union territory. The BJP again made a clean sweep, squashing all hopes of Kejriwal, who has since gone back to prison. He had been out on bail briefly.
The AAP, which has a government in Punjab, however has managed to win three seats in the state. The Congress took seven out of the 13 seats there.
The other strong mandate against the authoritarian tactics of the BJP has come from the state of Maharashtra, where last time the BJP won big. In 2024, its former ally, the Shiv Sena (which split into two rival branches), has come back to haunt it, with the Uddhav Thakeray-led group winning nine seats. Similarly, the NCP of veteran leader Sharad Pawar (which had also split into two at the behest of the BJP) won eight seats. In total the INDIA coalition won 30 of the total 48 seats while the BJP alliance has been reduced to half  from 41 in 2019 to 18 seats in 2024. The Congress improved its tally from one seat to 13 seats this time.
In an earlier article, way back in March, I had correctly predicted that this time, victory may not be a cake walk for the BJP. Analyzing the reasons why Narendra Modi, possibly for the first time in a decade, was nervous ahead of the elections, I had cited how his anti- corruption crusader image had been dented with the electoral bonds disclosures. The crucial Supreme Court verdict had exposed how the BJP benefited from secret electoral bonds, and used them as the largest extortion racket.
With this 2024 verdict, most importantly, the invincibility of Modi and his God complex have been put to rest.
